    Focal colors, or best examples of color terms, have traditionally been
    viewed as either the underlying source of cross-language color-naming
    universals or derived from category boundaries that vary widely across
    languages. Existing data partially support and partially challenge each of
    these views. Here, we advance a position that synthesizes aspects of these
    two traditionally opposed positions and accounts for existing data. We do so
    by linking this debate to more general principles. We show that best
    examples of named color categories across 112 languages are well-predicted
    from category extensions by a statistical model of how representative a
    sample is of a distribution, independently shown to account for patterns of
    human inference. This model accounts for both universal tendencies and
    variation in focal colors across languages. We conclude that categorization
    in the contested semantic domain of color may be governed by principles that
    apply more broadly in cognition and that these principles clarify the
    interplay of universal and language-specific forces in color naming.

    Many sophisticated computer models have been developed to understand the
    behaviour of particle accelerators. Even these complex models often do not
    describe the measured data. Interactions of the beam with external fields,
    other particles in the same beam and the beam walls all present modelling
    challenges. These can be challenging to model correctly even with modern
    supercomputers. This paper describes OPAL (Object Oriented Parallel
    Accelerator Library), a parallel open source tool for charged-particle
    optics in linear accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge. OPAL is
    built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact
    that high performance computing is the third leg of science, complementing
    theory and experiment. Using the MAD language with extensions, OPAL can run
    on a laptop as well as on the largest high performance computing systems.
    The OPAL framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++
    classes, enabling the modelling of many physics processes and field types.
    OPAL comes in two flavours: OPAL-cycl: tracks particles with 3D space charge
    including neighbouring turns in cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the
    independent variable. OPAL-t: models beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors
    and complete XFELs excluding the undulator. The code is managed through the
    git distributed version control system. A suite of unit tests have been
    developed for various parts of OPAL, validating each part of the code
    independently. System tests validate the overall integration of different
    elements.

    This paper investigates how strategy formulation and implementation
    processes used by the University of Cape Coast (UCC) in building its digital
    collections compare with the Andrew’s strategic formulation and
    implementation theoretical framework. Theory-testing case study methodology
    was used. The data collection instruments were the key informant interview
    technique and document reviews. During the formulation phase, two aspects
    (resources and aspirations of senior management) were emergent. During the
    implementation phase, five aspects (achieving results, processes and
    behaviour, standards, motivation, personal) were emergent. All other
    elements of building the UCC digital collections were planned during both
    the formulation and implementation phases. Although the emphasis on students
    and learning is laudable and apt, there seems to be lack of focus on
    research support beyond digital collection building, despite the fact that
    research excellence is one of the UCC’s key priorities. Opportunities exist
    for improving feedback mechanisms between the users, digital library staff
    and the university management; and inclusion of social media tools in the
    digital library project. Since only the experience of a single institution
    of higher learning is considered, it cannot be definitively stated that
    strategy formulation and implementation will be similar in every
    institutional context. However, the results provide a basis for academic
    digital libraries to draw lessons from this case. In African public
    universities, there is little earlier research on strategy formulation and
    implementation in digital library management. Strategy formulation and
    implementation is a critical issue for higher education academic libraries
    especially in developing countries like Ghana, due to limited financial
    resources and the rapid change in the information environment during the
    last several decades.

    realistic and appealing atmosphere in many virtual environments. However,
    they do occupy a significant amount of computational resources. The demand
    for more advanced graphics increases by each generation, likewise does
    particle systems need to become increasingly more detailed. Objectives. This
    thesis proposes a texture-based 3D vector field particle system, computed on
    the Graphics Processing Unit, and compares it to an equation-based particle
    system. Methods. Several tests were conducted comparing different situations
    and parameters for the methods. All of the tests measured the computational
    time needed to execute the different methods. Results. We show that the
    texture-based method was effective in very specific situations where it was
    expected to outperform the equation-based. Otherwise, the equation-based
    particle system is still the most efficient. Conclusions. Generally the
    equation-based method is preferred, except for in very specific cases. The
    texture-based is most efficient to use for static particle systems and when
    a huge number of forces is applied to a particle system. Texture-based
    vector fields is hardly useful otherwise.

    Nonprofit Organizations need strategies to be effective, but the available
    tools for making strategy were developed primarily for business
    organizations. This book provides a model and several case studies for
    Strategy Making in Nonprofit Organizations. The strategy making model
    modifies the business practices of Strategy-Structure-Systems for the
    nonprofit context with a focus on Purpose-Processes-People that is more
    suitable to meet their unique challenges. In this book, the leaders of
    nonprofit organizations will find ways to better articulate the challenges
    that their organizations face for communicating with their business
    partners, donors and employees. As the demand for essential social services
    is growing and the budgets are declining, leaders and managers in both
    Nonprofit and Business organizations need the solutions offered in this
    book. Nonprofit Organizations face an external environment where demand
    outstrips their ability to meet it. They face competition in raising funds
    and resources to provide these services. They rely on processes to harness
    the creativity of their people in delivering to the triple bottom line of
    economic, social and environmental impact. This book provides a bridge
    between business and nonprofit organizations.

    Graphics Shaders: Theory and Practice is intended for a second course in
    computer graphics at the undergraduate or graduate level, introducing shader
    programming in general, but focusing on the GLSL shading language. While
    teaching how to write programmable shaders, the authors also teach and
    reinforce the fundamentals of computer graphics. The second edition has been
    updated to incorporate changes in the OpenGL API (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0)
    and also has a chapter on the new tessellation shaders, including many
    practical examples. The book starts with a quick review of the graphics
    pipeline, emphasizing features that are rarely taught in introductory
    courses, but are immediately exposed in shader work. It then covers
    shader-specific theory for vertex, tessellation, geometry, and fragment
    shaders using the GLSL 4.x0 shading language. The text also introduces the
    freely available glman tool that enables you to develop, test, and tune
    shaders separately from the applications that will use them. The authors
    explore how shaders can be used to support a wide variety of applications
    and present examples of shaders in 3D geometry, scientific visualization,
    geometry morphing, algorithmic art, and more. Features of the Second
    Edition: Written using the most recent specification releases (OpenGL 4.x
    and GLSL 4.x0) including code examples brought up-to-date with the current
    standard of the GLSL language. More examples and more exercises A chapter on
    tessellation shaders An expanded Serious Fun chapter with examples that
    illustrate using shaders to produce fun effects A discussion of how to
    handle the major changes occurring in the OpenGL standard, and some C++
    classes to help you manage that transition The authors thoroughly explain
    the concepts, use sample code to describe details of the concepts, and then
    challenge you to extend the examples. They provide sample source code for
    many of the book’s examples at www.cgeducation.org

    The empirical evidence that human color categorization exhibits some
    universal patterns beyond superficial discrepancies across different
    cultures is a major breakthrough in cognitive science. As observed in the
    World Color Survey (WCS), indeed, any two groups of individuals develop
    quite different categorization patterns, but some universal properties can
    be identified by a statistical analysis over a large number of populations.
    Here, we reproduce the WCS in a numerical model in which different
    populations develop independently their own categorization systems by
    playing elementary language games. We find that a simple perceptual
    constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just Noticeable Difference
    (JND), is sufficient to trigger the emergence of universal patterns that
    unconstrained cultural interaction fails to produce. We test the results of
    our experiment against real data by performing the same statistical analysis
    proposed to quantify the universal tendencies shown in the WCS [Kay P &
    Regier T. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100: 9085-9089], and obtain an
    excellent quantitative agreement. This work confirms that synthetic modeling
    has nowadays reached the maturity to contribute significantly to the ongoing
    debate in cognitive science.

    This book is at the crossroads of web development and deep learning. Both
    technologies are beginning to meet, and this honeymoon will produce new
    fantastic applications that you cannot even imagine yet.


    In this book you will see how to concretely use the main JavaScript deep
    learning frameworks and web programming in the browser with the capture of
    inputs and the WebGL implementation. Deep learning in the browser is
    currently at an embryonic stage, but this is the best time to bet on it
    before it becomes a giant, and this book will get you in on the action.


    Are you ready to embark on the adventure?

    Great personas can lead to inspiration, innovation, and a focus on
    customers. But there are bad personas too! In this article, Jennifer Leigh
    Brown outlines why one static persona shouldn’t be used for every project,
    and explains the benefits of updating or creating new personas when

  abstract: >-
    Strategic planning becomes visual with strategy maps and the tools,
    techniques, and guidance for turning them into effective action. Developed
    as a companion workbook to John Bryson's best-selling Strategic Planning in
    Public and Nonprofit Organizations, Visual Strategy: A Workbook for Strategy
    Mapping in Public and Nonprofit Organizations, goes beyond making the case
    for good and effective strategic planning to making strategy visual through
    effective strategy mapping. Strategy mapping prevents groups of people from
    talking over one another and going around in circles. It helps people speak
    and be heard, produce lots of ideas and understand how they fit together,
    make use of causal reasoning, and clarify ultimately what they want to do in
    terms of mission, goals, strategies, and actions. Strategy mapping can join
    process and content in such a way that good ideas worth implementing are
    found and the agreements and comments needed to implement them are reached.
    The result is living strategic plans that act as useful guides to action.
    With detailed examples, actual strategy maps, process guidelines and
    hand-drawn illustrations, the book will help leaders, managers, students and
    other professionals see patterns across mission, goals, strategies and
    actions while helping to identify areas of alignment and misalignment and
    determine, real time, where elements are needed, missing or not useful in a
    strategic plan. For leaders and managers of public and nonprofit
    organizations, facilitators and consultants, professors and students of
    strategic planning, strategic management, strategic mapping, and public
    policy, professional development workshops focused on strategic planning and
    strategy mapping.

    Internet voting continues to raise interest. A large number of Internet
    voting schemes are available, both in use, as well as in research
    literature. While these schemes are all based on different security models,
    most of these models are not adequate for high-stake elections. Furthermore,
    it is not known how to evaluate the understandability of these schemes
    (although this is important to enable voters' trust in the election result).
    Therefore, we propose and justify an adequate security model and criteria to
    evaluate understandability. We also describe an Internet voting scheme,
    Pretty Understandable Democracy, show that it satisfies the adequate
    security model and that it is more understandable than Pretty Good
    Democracy, currently the only scheme that also satisfies the proposed
    security model. Index Terms-Cryptography, Internet Voting, Code Voting,
    Security Model, Understandability

    This handbook is written for governments and organizations considering
    whether or not to conduct e-voting pilot schemes and trials or to make
    e-voting a feature of their electoral system. It reviews issues such as
    building and safeguarding trust in the system, the value of open-source
    software and the implications of a voter verifiable audit paper trail.
    Concrete e-voting issues are discussed in the framework of the electoral
    cycle.--Publisher's description.

    The importance of strategy and strategy construct is not a new phenomenon.
    However as strategy work becomes less tangible, concerns with understanding,
    describing, and managing strategies develops into an increasingly complex
    subject. Current strategy concepts are dispersed and lack integration.
    Moreover, the enablement of modelling practices around strategy concepts
    considering the entire strategy lifecycle are also missing. Consequently,
    this paper focuses on issues with strategy in theory and practice, why a
    strategy ontology is needed and how this can be developed.

    We examine the popular Personas method and consider claims that personas can
    reflect empirical data and serve as an information source for development
    teams. We argue that there are significant methodological and practical
    difficulties for personas. It is difficult to determine how many, if any,
    users are represented by a persona, and thus is difficult to know whether a
    persona is relevant for intended users. Personas cannot be adequately
    verified or falsified and therefore have no demonstrable validity. We
    believe personas are likely to lead to political conflicts and to undermine
    the ability for researchers to resolve questions with data. We suggest
    potential research to evaluate the Personas method more thoroughly. Until
    the methodological issues are resolved, it is best not to consider personas
    to be a means to communicate data.

    The personas method is said to present information about people of interest
    for product design. We propose a formal model to understand persona
    information in terms of factual attributes. Using an analytic model, we show
    that the expected prevalence rate of persona descriptions decreases rapidly
    as attributes are added. We then evaluate this expectation empirically.
    Using six survey datasets ranging from N=268 to N=10307 respondents and two
    simulated datasets, we determine the prevalence rates of 10000 randomly
    generated persona-like descriptions per dataset. Consistent with prediction,
    we observe decreasing prevalence rates as attributes are added. Pearson’s r
    for observed vs. predicted prevalence, transformed to multinormality, ranges
    r(9998)=0.394 to r(9998)=0.869 in the sampled datasets (all p < 0.001).
    Because descriptions with many attributes are likely to represent few
    people, we suggest that personas should be assessed empirically before they
    are assumed to describe real groups of people.

    Understanding the Professional Buyer is a practical guide for sales people,
    giving them insight into the behaviour and strategies of buyers, so that
    they are able to deal with them more successfully and regain power in the
    buyer-seller relationship. In recent years the balance of power between
    buyer and seller has swung dramatically in favour of the buyer. Sellers are
    now faced with more professional, more knowledgeable and more powerful
    buyers - and the sales techniques used in previous years are no longer
    working. This book shows how to understand this new breed of buyer, in order
    to interact with them on a more level playing field. Contents include
    developments in the industry; purchasing organizations; types of buyers;
    purchasing analysis; and crucially, buyer-seller relations.

    The strategic emphasis in this book is as much on keeping customers as on
    getting them in the first place. The aim is to provide unique value in
    chosen markets, sustainable over time, which bring the customers back for
    more. Relationship marketing emphasizes both quality and customer service
    and how these can be managed towards closing the "quality gap" between what
    customers expect and what they get.

  title: Verifiability notions for e-voting protocols
  type: paper-conference

- id: cortier_sok_2016
  abstract: >-
    There have been intensive research efforts in the last two decades or so to
    design and deploy electronic voting (e-voting) protocols/systems which allow
    voters and/or external auditors to check that the votes were counted
    correctly. This security property, which not least was motivated by numerous
    problems in even national elections, is called veriﬁability. It is meant to
    defend against voting devices and servers that have programming errors or
    are outright malicious. In order to properly evaluate and analyze e-voting
    protocols w.r.t. veriﬁability, one fundamental challenge has been to
    formally capture the meaning of this security property. While the ﬁrst
    formal deﬁnitions of veriﬁability were devised in the late 1980s already,
    new veriﬁability deﬁnitions are still being proposed. The deﬁnitions differ
    in various aspects, including the classes of protocols they capture and even
    their formulations of the very core of the meaning of veriﬁability. This is
    an unsatisfying state of affairs, leaving the research on the veriﬁability
    of e-voting protocols in a fuzzy state.

    Alexander Dierks conceptualizes and applies a more nuanced model of the
    brand purchase funnel. The re-conceptualization builds on a holistic,
    theory-based, and practically applicable set of 10 propositions, which
    capture dynamics of consumers’ contemporary search and decision behavior and
    allow for a more differentiated assessment of brand performance across the
    buying cycle. The model’s value add is investigated based on two
    survey-based studies from the automotive and the electricity industry. Using
    logistic regression analysis, the author uncovers insightful differences in
    the determinants of consumers’ purchase decisions depending on the stage of
    consideration set formation. The findings support the employment of the more
    nuanced funnel in brand management.

    "When Stanley Morison wrote in First Principles of Typography that
    "Typography does not so much need Inspiration or Revival as Investigation,"
    he may well have had Geoffrey Dowding in mind. Few people investigate,
    dissect and care about type with the passion and intensity of Dowding. He
    probes into every aspect & use of type and space, from word and letter
    arrangement to the design of type itself. He's readable, absorbing and
    provocative; no matter how you feel about Geoffrey Dowding's opinions, you
    will never approach design in quite the same way after having read Finer
    Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type. If you care about design and
    the printed word, then you care about what Geoffrey Dowding has to
    say."–BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America,

    The explosion of digital technologies over the past decade has created
    “empowered” consumers so expert in their use of tools and information that
    they can call the shots, hunting down what they want when they want it and
    getting it delivered to their doorsteps at a rock-bottom price. In response,
    retailers and service providers have scrambled to develop big data and
    analytics capabilities in order to understand their customers and wrest back
    control. For much of this time, companies have been reacting to customers,
    trying to anticipate their next moves and position themselves in shoppers’
    paths as they navigate the decision journey from consideration to purchase.

    A comprehensive guide with coverage on AudioFX, Particle system, shaders,
    sequencers, and the latest features of Unreal 4.19 that will take your game
    development skills to the next level Key Features Create a high-performance
    Combat game using the essential features of Unreal Engine 4.18+. Master the
    complex competitive features needed in modern games such as Volumetric
    Lightmaps and Precomputed Lighting on Volumetric Fog, and build an
    impressive UI. Experience not only VR support for your game but also the
    inbuilt support of Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore with UE4's newly
    released support for these platforms. Book Description To make a basic
    combat game from scratch, you will quickly override existing UE4 classes,
    and add and implement simple C++ functions while running and building them.
    These are all discussed as a short summary for new developers and as a quick
    refresher for experienced developers. Next, you will build a combat player
    character with expanded controls, create logic for a character, swap
    weapons, attack and move, bridge over scene changes and transitions, retain
    data between scenes, and manage the scene-change process. You will then
    build an intelligent enemy AI and add physics based particles for weapon
    impacts. You will also get acquainted with cutting-edge features such as
    Volumetric Lightmaps for precomputed lighting, and Atmospheric and
    Volumetric Fog, to build advanced visuals in our ongoing GitHub project.
    Moving on, you will explore the tools required to build an in-game cut-scene
    for a more professional gameplay experience and story direction. Along the
    way, you will implement a solid game UI, including writing a full in-game
    load and save system that will enable players to resume their game from any
    point. You will also prepare, build, and work on VR and AR taking them from
    editor to real-world, building two new projects one in each of these brand
    new areas of UE4 and integrate classes from the main project into AR! By the
    end of the book, you will have mastered all major UE features and will be
    able to bring self-imagined games to life through Unreal Engine 4.18+. What
    you will learn The fundamentals of a combat-based game that will let you
    build and work all other systems from the core gameplay: the input,
    inventory, A.I. enemies, U.I., and audio Manage performance tools and
    branching shaders based on platform capabilities in the Material Editor

    Important elements of games, movies, and other computer-generated content,
    shadows are crucial for enhancing realism and providing important visual
    cues. In recent years, there have been notable improvements in visual
    quality and speed, making high-quality realistic real-time shadows a
    reachable goal. Real-Time Shadows is a comprehensive guide to the theory and
    practice of real-time shadow techniques. It covers a large variety of
    different effects, including hard, soft, volumetric, and semi-transparent
    shadows. The book explains the basics as well as many advanced aspects
    related to the domain of shadow computation. It presents interactive
    solutions and practical details on shadow computation. The authors compare
    various algorithms for creating real-time shadows and illustrate how they
    are used in different situations. They explore the limitations and failure
    cases, advantages and disadvantages, and suitability of the algorithms in
    several applications. Source code, videos, tutorials, and more are available
    on the book’s website www.realtimeshadows.com.

    How do executives make decisions? Based on what? Are their decisions
    conscious or unconscious? Can they explain each decision they make? What
    tools can they use to improve their decision-making process? What rules of
    thumb (heuristics) can they use when faced with decision-making challenges?
    These are some of the questions this book is about. During the past 30
    years, as an entrepreneur and senior executive of several medium-sized
    Canadian hi-tech businesses, the author observed his decision-making
    processes to be based either on experience or on advice received from
    colleagues. Seldom were decisions based on formal or informal academic-based
    methods. Discussing decision-making methods with other executives of
    comparable business backgrounds confirms they rely on similar methods when
    looking for solutions to challenging business problems. There is no
    substitute for years of experience in any human endeavour. However, tapping
    into some of the methods and lessons learned from personal experience can
    result in useful principles for others to follow. These principles might be
    useful especially for entrepreneurs interested in building their businesses
    or executives looking for some additional help in acquiring a better
    decision-making mouse-trap.

  abstract: >-
    What determines how languages categorize colors? We analyzed results of the
    World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show that despite gross
    differences across languages, communication of chromatic chips is always
    better for warm colors (yellows/reds) than cool colors (blues/greens). We
    present an analysis of color statistics in a large databank of natural
    images curated by human observers for salient objects and show that objects
    tend to have warm rather than cool colors. These results suggest that the
    cross-linguistic similarity in color-naming efficiency reflects colors of
    universal usefulness and provide an account of a principle (color use) that
    governs how color categories come about. We show that potential
    methodological issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic
    analyses, by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the
    color-naming task, in three groups: the Tsimane', a remote Amazonian
    hunter-gatherer isolate; Bolivian-Spanish speakers; and English speakers.
    These data also enabled us to test another prediction of the
    color-usefulness hypothesis: that differences in color categorization
    between languages are caused by differences in overall usefulness of color
    to a culture. In support, we found that color naming among Tsimane' had
    relatively low communicative efficiency, and the Tsimane' were less likely
    to use color terms when describing familiar objects. Color-naming among
    Tsimane' was boosted when naming artificially colored objects compared with
    natural objects, suggesting that industrialization promotes color
    usefulness.

    This chapter describes learning electromagnetism with visualizations and
    focuses on the value of concrete and visual representations in teaching
    abstract concepts. We start with a theoretical background consisting of
    three subsections: visualization in science, simulations and
    microcomputer-based laboratory, and studies that investigated the
    effectiveness of simulations and real-time graphing in physics. We then
    present the TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) project for MIT's
    introductory electromagnetism course as a case in point. We demonstrate the
    various types of visualizations and how they are used in the TEAL classroom.
    A description of a large-scale study at MIT follows. In this study, we
    investigated the effects of introducing 2D and 3D visualizations into an
    active learning setting on learning outcomes in both the cognitive and
    affective domains. We conclude by describing an example of TEAL classroom
    discourse, which demonstrates the effects and benefits of the TEAL project
    in general, and the active learning and visualizations in particular.

    OpenGL® ES is the industry's leading software interface and graphics library
    for rendering sophisticated 3D graphics on handheld and embedded devices.
    The newest version, OpenGL ES 3.0, makes it possible to create stunning
    visuals for new games and apps, without compromising device performance or
    battery life. In the OpenGL ® ES 3.0 Programming Guide, Second Edition, the
    authors cover the entire API and Shading Language. They carefully introduce
    OpenGL ES 3.0 features such as shadow mapping, instancing, multiple render
    targets, uniform buffer objects, texture compression, program binaries, and
    transform feedback. Through detailed, downloadable C-based code examples,
    you'll learn how to set up and program every aspect of the graphics
    pipeline. Step by step, you'll move from introductory techniques all the way
    to advanced per-pixel lighting and particle systems. Throughout, you'll find
    cutting-edge tips for optimizing performance, maximizing efficiency with
    both the API and hardware, and fully leveraging OpenGL ES 3.0 in a wide
    spectrum of applications. All code has been built and tested on iOS 7,
    Android 4.3, Windows (OpenGL ES 3.0 Emulation), and Ubuntu Linux, and the
    authors demonstrate how to build OpenGL ES code for each platform. Coverage
    in c ludes EGL API: communicating with the native windowing system, choosing
    configurations, and creating rendering contexts and surfaces Shaders:
    creating and attaching shader objects; compiling shaders; checking for
    compile errors; creating, linking, and querying program objects; and using
    source shaders and program binaries OpenGL ES Shading Language: variables,
    types, constructors, structures, arrays, attributes, uniform blocks, I/O
    variables, precision qualifiers, and invariance Geometry, vertices, and
    primitives: inputting geometry into the pipeline, and assembling it into
    primitives 2D/3D, Cubemap, Array texturing: creation, loading, and
    rendering; texture wrap modes, filtering, and formats; compressed textures,
    sampler objects, immutable textures, pixel unpack buffer objects, and
    mipmapping Fragment shaders: multitexturing, fog, alpha test, and user clip
    planes Fragment operations: scissor, stencil, and depth tests;
    multisampling, blending, and dithering Framebuffer objects: rendering to
    offscreen surfaces for advanced effects Advanced rendering: per-pixel
    lighting, environment mapping, particle systems, image post-processing,
    procedural textures, shadow mapping, terrain, and projective textures.

    be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and
    virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions
    such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of
    floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems.
    It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding
    error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and
    concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support
    floating point.

    Thinking and planning for the future is critical in a competitive business
    world. Scenarios are a common technique for investigating the future, but
    can be time-consuming and challenging to develop, particularly when more
    than a single organisation is involved. An approach is presented here which
    shifts the focus of scenario building from the company level to the sector
    level, whereby a range of organisations engage collectively on a topic of
    mutual importance. A rapid technique was developed, with simple scenarios
    being constructed in 2 to 4 hours. This process was implemented in 13
    multi-organisational workshops with participants from the construction and
    building industries, sectors which are traditionally short-term and reactive
    in their outlook. The resulting feedback, observations and experiences are
    discussed, together with examples of how the resultant scenarios have been
    applied. An example of causal map reflection (exposing an individual’s
    causal map to others) is also presented, described and critiqued. It was
    found that the process was successful in engaging participants in thinking
    about and discussing the future, appreciating the interconnectivities of the
    related issues, and understanding the collective implications of their
    potential decisions, as well as facilitating the socialisation of
    participant thinking and the construction of collective futures.

    Can a project be both a success and a failure? You may be hitting your
    deadlines and keeping within your budget... but if your project isn't
    meeting your organization's larger strategic goals, it may actually be
    failing. While it is broadly accepted that projects are the building blocks
    in implementing organizational strategic objectives, many books fail to
    address one critical question: how do you translate a strategic objective
    into a manageable project task? Lavishly illustrated with more than 40
    figures and tables, this latest book from practitioner and project
    management professor Mih ly G r g, PhD addresses this critical lack, for
    project managers of all levels. With each of its chapters devoted to
    exploring a specific topic, the book begins by focusing on internal projects
    within an organization. Using real-world examples from multiple industries,
    Dr. G r g effortlessly provides both theory and practical tools for thinking
    and working strategically throughout the project process, including
    mastering scope challenges and evaluating project success. The second half
    of the book then explores how to meet the unique strategic challenges
    presented by projects involving external contractors and includes how to
    differentiate between contract and payment; allocate responsibilities and
    risks; create contractor competition; and identify the best bid (and
    bidder). Strategic Oriented Implementation of Projects is that rare book
    that is both strategic oriented and practical and provides project and
    program managers with the tools to ensure that their internal and external
    projects actually meet their organization's strategic goals.

    This paper studies tourism‐related service processes from the customer’s
    perspective, acknowledging the extraordinary and hedonic nature of these
    offerings. Instead of looking at a chronological journey of different
    service phases, the entire tourist experience is analysed in a
    socio‐cultural context. By revealing this deeper context, the study provides
    an alternative explanation of customers’ perceptions of tourism destinations
    and service providers.

    We show how to extend the Helios voting system to provide eligibility
    veriﬁability without revealing who voted which we call private eligibility
    veriﬁability. The main idea is that real votes are hidden in a crowd of null
    votes that are cast by others but are indistinguishable from those of the
    eligible voter. This extended Helios scheme also improves Helios towards
    receipt-freeness.

    It's time to stop thinking that shaders are magical. You can use shaders to
    turn data into stunning visual effects, and get your hands dirty by building
    your own shader with this step-by-step introduction to shader development
    for game and graphics developers. Learn how to make shaders that move, tint,
    light up, and look awesome, all without cracking open a math textbook.
    Practical Shader Development teaches the theory behind how shaders work. The
    book also shows you how to apply that theory to create eye-popping visual
    effects. You'll learn to profile and optimize those effects to make sure
    your projects keep running quickly with all their new visuals. You'll learn
    good theory, good practices, and without getting bogged down in the math.
    Author Kyle Halladay explains the fundamentals of shader development through
    simple examples and hands-on experiments. He teaches you how to find
    performance issues in shaders you are using and then how to fix them. Kyle
    explains (and contrasts) how to use the knowledge learned from this book in
    three of the most popular game engines today. What You'll Learn Understand
    what shaders are and how they work Get up to speed on the nuts and bolts of
    writing vertex and fragment shaders Utilize color blending and know how
    blend equations work Know the coordinate spaces used when rendering
    real-time computer graphics Use simple math to animate characters, simulate
    lights, and create a wide variety of visual effects Find and fix performance
    problems in shaders See how three popular game engines (Unity, UE4, Godot)
    handle shaders Who This Book Is For Programmers who are interested in
    writing their own shaders but do not know where to start, anyone who has
    ever seen shader code on a forum and wished they knew how to modify it just
    a little bit to fit into their own projects, and game developers who are
    tired of using the default shaders found in the game engines they are using.
    The book is especially useful for those who have been put off by existing
    shader tutorials which introduce complex math and graphics theory before
    ever getting something on the screen.

    Technologists who want their ideas heard, understood, and funded are often
    told to speak the language of business--without really knowing what that is.
    This book's toolkit provides architects, product managers, technology
    managers, and executives with a shared language--in the form of repeatable,
    practical patterns and templates--to produce great technology strategies.
    Author Eben Hewitt developed 39 patterns over the course of a decade in his
    work as CTO, CIO, and chief architect for several global tech companies.
    With these proven tools, you can define, create, elaborate, refine, and
    communicate your architecture goals, plans, and approach in a way that
    executives can readily understand, approve, and execute. This book covers:
    Architecture and strategy: Adopt a strategic architectural mindset to make a
    meaningful material impact Creating your strategy: Define the components of
    your technology strategy using proven patterns Communicating the strategy:
    Convey your technology strategy in a compelling way to a variety of
    audiences Bringing it all together: Employ patterns individually or in
    clusters for specific problems; use the complete framework for a
    comprehensive strategy

    Inside Paragraphs is about what goes on inside a paragraph of printed text.
    The goal is to help students train their eyes to see text as typographers
    do. It begins with general explanations of how type works and how we read.
    Then the author steps through the different kinds of space within a
    paragraph. Finally, it puts everything together with a discussion about
    paragraph settings. Typography began with paragraphs of printed text. Since
    then, it has evolved in all sorts of directions, sometimes leaving ink and
    paper behind entirely. But the printed paragraph is still a good starting
    point. Understanding what goes on inside provides a solid foundation on
    which to build. And that's what this book is meant to be -- a foundation.
    Inside Paragraphs is the book Highsmith always wanted when he was a student
    in his first typography course.

    Vector-ﬁeld data arises from applications contexts including: sensor
    outputs; ﬂow-ﬁelds for image analysis; and dataset visualisation. We have
    experimented with various approaches to analysing and visualising
    vector-ﬁeld data sets. We extend this to threedimensional vector-ﬁeld data
    and present various ways to process them in real or near-real time using
    data parallelism. We show how to implement contouring and 3D line
    integration techniques using graphical processing units and report on the
    performance attainable. We discuss how these techniques can be applied in
    processing vector-ﬁeld signal data in interactive applications.

    GPU Computing Gems, Jade Edition, offers hands-on, proven techniques for
    general purpose GPU programming based on the successful application
    experiences of leading researchers and developers. One of few resources
    available that distills the best practices of the community of CUDA
    programmers, this second edition contains 100% new material of interest
    across industry, including finance, medicine, imaging, engineering, gaming,
    environmental science, and green computing. It covers new tools and
    frameworks for productive GPU computing application development and provides
    immediate benefit to researchers developing improved programming
    environments for GPUs. Divided into five sections, this book explains how
    GPU execution is achieved with algorithm implementation techniques and
    approaches to data structure layout. More specifically, it considers three
    general requirements: high level of parallelism, coherent memory access by
    threads within warps, and coherent control flow within warps. Chapters
    explore topics such as accelerating database searches; how to leverage the
    Fermi GPU architecture to further accelerate prefix operations; and GPU
    implementation of hash tables. There are also discussions on the state of
    GPU computing in interactive physics and artificial intelligence;
    programming tools and techniques for GPU computing; and the edge and node
    parallelism approach for computing graph centrality metrics. In addition,
    the book proposes an alternative approach that balances computation
    regardless of node degree variance. Software engineers, programmers,
    hardware engineers, and advanced students will find this book extremely
    useful. This second volume of GPU Computing Gems offers 100% new material of
    interest across industry, including finance, medicine, imaging, engineering,
    gaming, environmental science, green computing, and more Covers new tools
    and frameworks for productive GPU computing application development and
    offers immediate benefit to researchers developing improved programming

    Projects have become the de facto method of implementing business strategy
    and operations. As such, understanding how projects relate to business
    strategy and managing projects strategically is increasingly important to
    effective and efficient business management This book is designed as a short
    and concise treatise on how to go about doing that. The authors start by
    figuring out how the project relates to the rest of the business and
    environment and what separates it from other projects and functions. They go
    on to discuss how you can use principles of strategic management to better
    organize and manage the various projects you may be dealing with on a daily
    basis so that they are strategic in nature. In essence, this book details
    how to approach answering the important strategic questions in project
    management like—“Why is the project being implemented? How does the project
    relate to the major strategic goals of the organization? How do we
    accomplish the performance goals for the project so that they help achieve
    the major strategic goals of the organization?”

    Many companies recognize the importance of customer experience and emphasize
    a few select “customer touchpoints.” But the authors of a new Harvard
    Business Review article suggest that this may not be good enough. While
    individual touchpoints matter, what matters even more is a customer’s
    complete, cumulative, end-to-end journey. Currently, few companies do an
    outstanding job […]

  abstract: >-
    From late 1980s and early twenty-first century, the environment where the
    organizations develop and act, has become increasingly uncertain and
    complex. Under these conditions, organizations have detected the need to
    move towards a more participatory model to address and reduce the
    complexity, based on information and knowledge as core assets to reduce
    environmental uncertainty and thereby ensure better decision-making. This
    new form of governance involves changes in the Strategic Planning process
    that are aligned with the characteristics of the new organizational model.
    Ontologies, as theories of content that allow the formalization of processes
    and knowledge, are a key element in this context. The aim of this paper is
    to formally define an ontology that could be defined in the future using the
    Web Ontology Language (OWL) that meets the standards approved by the World
    Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and that is used to formalize the process of SP,
    as well as the knowledge that is created and flows among the several
    participants in the process.

    Der Trend setzt sich fort. Mit Strategy Maps kann das
    Balanced-Scorecard-System noch wirkungsvoller eingesetzt werden. Wie
    funktioniert das? Die Strategy Maps entwickeln Ursache-Wirkungs-Ketten. Sie
    legen offen, welche strategischen Entscheidungen zu welchen messbaren
    Ergebnissen führen. Strategy Maps beruhen auf einer einfachen Philosophie:
    Man kann nur umsetzen, was man messen kann. Man kann nur messen, was man
    beschreiben kann. In der Praxis helfen die Strategy Maps, verständlich zu
    kommunizieren. Die Strategy Maps zeichnen den Ablaufplan auf, nach dem die
    Zielvorgaben umgesetzt werden sollen. Sie bieten eine ideale Unterstützung,
    weil immaterielle Vermögenswerte wie das Human-, Informations- und
    Organisationskapital in die Strategie eingebunden werden müssen. Das Konzept
    der Erfolgsautoren Kaplan und Norton ist ein Meilenstein für die
    strategische Unternehmensführung.

    There is increasing interest in cryptographic veriﬁability in remote
    electronic voting schemes. Helios is one example of an open-source
    implementation. In previous work, we proposed an improved version of the
    original Helios interface in version 3.1 for vote casting and individual
    veriﬁability. We now test this interface in a mock mayoral election set up
    with 34 users. Users are given instructions and ﬁll out questionnaires
    before and after the vote casting process. Data on mouse movements and time
    is collected and a modiﬁed helmet with eye tracking lenses is used to
    capture eye movement data. The study shows that the interface is easy to use
    while people have difﬁculty understanding the motivation for and the concept
    of veriﬁability.

    Business process modeling is an important aspect of analyzing the needs of a
    modern firm. The models produced are used in diverse ways including
    understanding services delivered to customers, underpinning enterprise
    architecture, explaining future changes and the automation of processes, and
    in defining information technology to support processes. However, there is
    also a diversity of modeling techniques used. This paper is an explication
    of three of the most popular: service blueprinting, business process
    modeling notation (BPMN), and a new approach called process chain network
    (PCN). The paper concludes with future works to better understand how these
    approaches can be used in conjunction. JEL Classifications: M000, M150

    Mit der elektronischen Stimmabgabe, z. B. online über den heimischen PC oder
    per Smartphone, wird angestrebt, eine ergänzende Möglichkeit zur
    herkömmlichen Wahl per Stimmzettel oder Brief zu schaffen.
    Onlineabstimmungen können vor allem solchen Wählergruppen die Wahlteilnahme
    erleichtern, die bei herkömmlichen Abstimmungsprozeduren auf gewisse
    Zugangshürden stoßen. Hierzu zählen unter anderem Menschen mit körperlichen
    Einschränkungen, Ältere oder Personen, die sich vorübergehend oder permanent
    im Ausland aufhalten. Neben diesen Vorzügen der Onlineabstimmung besteht
    allerdings auch eine erhöhte Gefahr der Manipulation von Wahlen. Manche
    befürchten überdies, dass die Onlineabstimmung zur „Banalisierung“ des
    Wahlakts führt und wichtige Grundsätze politischer Wahlen wie die
    Öffentlichkeit der Wahl verletzt.


    In rund 15 Ländern wurden bzw. werden bereits Onlineabstimmungssysteme bei
    lokalen bzw. nationalen politischen Wahlen eingesetzt. Estland ist
    diesbezüglich ein Vorreiter und zeichnet sich durch seine besonders frühe
    und kontinuierliche Nutzung von Onlineabstimmungssystemen aus. Seit 2005
    hatten die Wahlberechtigten in der baltischen Republik bereits achtmal die
    Möglichkeit, ihre Stimme bei kommunalen, nationalen und
    Europaparlamentswahlen auch online abzugeben. Eine wichtige
    infrastrukturelle Voraussetzung für die Durchführung ist der moderne, mit
    dem deutschen vergleichbare Personalausweis mit digitalen ID-Funktionen, mit
    dessen Hilfe die Identität der Wählerinnen und Wähler eindeutig verifiziert
    werden kann.


    In Deutschland ist die Debatte um die Einführung von Onlineabstimmungen mit
    dem Urteil des Bundesverfassungsgerichts zur Nutzung von Wahlautomaten aus
    dem Jahr 2009 abgeflaut. Entsprechend den Wahlrechtsgrundsätzen nach Artikel
    38 Absatz 1 des Grundgesetzes müssen auch Onlinewahlen frei, gleich,
    überprüfbar sowie geheim sein. Nach Auffassung des Verfassungsgerichts war
    der Grundsatz der Öffentlichkeit der Wahl, der auch die Ordnungsmäßigkeit
    und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Wahlvorgänge einschließt, beim Einsatz der
    Wahlcomputer nicht ausreichend gegeben. Bis heute überwiegen mit Blick auf
    E-Voting-Verfahren die Bedenken. Andererseits zeigt das Beispiel Schweiz, in
    dem Onlinewahlen seit 2003 erprobt werden, dass in einem föderalen Staat
    Onlinewahlen schrittweise akzeptiert werden. Umfragen zufolge könnten
    Onlinewahlen auch bei der deutschen Bevölkerung auf positive Resonanz
    stoßen.

    Elegant is an accelerator physics and particle-beam dynamics code widely
    used for modeling and design of a variety of high-energy particle
    accelerators and accelerator-based systems. We discuss a recently developed
    version of the code that can take advantage of CUDA-enabled graphics
    processing units (GPUs) to achieve significantly improved performance for a
    large class of simulations that are important in practice. The GPU version
    is largely defined by a framework that simplifies implementations of the
    fundamental kernel types that are used by Elegant: particle operations,
    reductions, particle loss, histograms, array convolutions and random number
    generation. Accelerated performance on the Titan Cray XK-7 supercomputer is
    approximately 6–10 times better with the GPU than all the CPU cores
    associated with the same node count. In addition to performance, the
    maintainability of the GPU-accelerated version of the code was considered a
    key design objective. Accuracy with respect to the CPU implementation is
    also a core consideration. Finally, four different methods are used to
    ensure that the accelerated code faithfully reproduces the CPU results.

    The idea of using the stencil buffer to generate shadows has been around for
    over a decade, but only recently has 3D graphics hardware advanced to the
    point where using the stencil algorithm on a large scale has become
    practical. Not long ago, there existed some unsolved problems pertaining to
    stencil shadows that prevented the algorithm from working correctly under
    various conditions. Advances have now been made, however, so that stencil
    shadows can be robustly implemented to handle arbitrarily positioned point
    lights and infinite directional lights having any desired spatial
    relationship with the camera. This article presents the intricacies of the
    entire stencil shadow algorithm and covers every mathematical detail of its
    efficient implementation.

    In this paper, we extend the concept of pre-ﬁltered shadow mapping to
    stochastic rasterization, enabling real-time rendering of soft shadows from
    planar area lights. Most existing soft shadow mapping methods lose important
    visibility information by relying on pinhole renderings from an area light
    source, providing plausible results only for small light sources. Since we
    sample the entire 4D shadow light ﬁeld stochastically, we are able to
    closely approximate shadows of large area lights as well. In order to
    efﬁciently reconstruct smooth shadows from this sparse data, we exploit the
    analogy of soft shadow computation to rendering defocus blur, and introduce
    a multiplane pre-ﬁltering algorithm. We demonstrate how existing
    pre-ﬁlterable approximations of the visibility function, such as variance
    shadow mapping, can be extended to four dimensions within our framework.

    We analyzed the color terms in the World Color Survey (WCS)
    (www.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/), a large color-naming database obtained from
    informants of mostly unwritten languages spoken in preindustrialized
    cultures that have had limited contact with modern, industrialized society.
    The color naming idiolects of 2,367 WCS informants fall into three to six
    “motifs,” where each motif is a different color-naming system based on a
    subset of a universal glossary of 11 color terms. These motifs are universal
    in that they occur worldwide, with some individual variation, in completely
    unrelated languages. Strikingly, these few motifs are distributed across the
    WCS informants in such a way that multiple motifs occur in most languages.
    Thus, the culture a speaker comes from does not completely determine how he
    or she will use color terms. An analysis of the modern patterns of motif
    usage in the WCS languages, based on the assumption that they reflect
    historical patterns of color term evolution, suggests that color lexicons
    have changed over time in a complex but orderly way. The worldwide
    distribution of the motifs and the cooccurrence of multiple motifs within
    languages suggest that universal processes control the naming of colors.

    The ability of existing strategy concepts to analyse strategy, design
    strategy and execute strategy within organisations has an alarmingly poor
    historical track record. Based on the long-standing semiotics and ontology
    research work of the Global University Alliance (GUA) and its members, a
    Strategy Lifecycle is introduced. The StrategyLifecycle, underpinned by
    ontology and semiotics incorporates all the constructs that can be found in
    the most popular strategy concepts and frameworks. It explains the value of
    the underlying strategy ontology and the relationship between the strategy
    meta model, the Strategy Lifecycle and various artefacts used around
    strategy work. The paper concludes with futurescope and application that
    lies ahead for the Strategy Lifecycle.

    Our all time best selling book is now available in a revised and expanded
    second edition. Thinking with Type is the definitive guide to using
    typography in visual communication, from the printed page to the computer
    screen. This revised edition includes forty-eight pages of new content,
    including the latest information on style sheets for print and the web, the
    use of ornaments and captions, lining and non-lining numerals, the use of
    small caps and enlarged capitals, as well as information on captions, font
    licensing, mixing typefaces, and hand lettering. Throughout the book, visual
    examples show how to be inventive within systems of typographic form—what
    the rules are and how to break them. Thinking with Type is a type book for
    everyone: designers, writers, editors, students, and anyone else who works
    with words. The popular online companion to Thinking with Type
    (www.thinkingwithtype.com) has been revised to reflect the new material in
    the second edition.

    We study the basic naming game model and the recently introduced Bayesian
    naming game model, in which the name learning processes are described more
    realistically within a Bayesian learning framework. We focus on the dynamics
    of the bilinguals population and show that in the Bayesian model the number
    of bilinguals is always lower with respect to the basic naming game model.
    We provide some analytical estimates of the upper bound for the number of
    bilinguals in both models and validate the estimate through extensive
    numerical simulations.

    Drawing on an impressive roster of experts in the field, Fundamentals of
    Computer Graphics, Fourth Edition offers an ideal resource for computer
    course curricula as well as a user-friendly personal or professional
    reference. Focusing on geometric intuition, the book gives the necessary
    information for understanding how images get onto the screen by using the
    complementary approaches of ray tracing and rasterization. It covers topics
    common to an introductory course, such as sampling theory, texture mapping,
    spatial data structure, and splines. It also includes a number of
    contributed chapters from authors known for their expertise and clear way of
    explaining concepts. Highlights of the Fourth Edition Include: Updated
    coverage of existing topics Major updates and improvements to several
    chapters, including texture mapping, graphics hardware, signal processing,
    and data structures A text now printed entirely in four-color to enhance
    illustrative figures of concepts The fourth edition of Fundamentals of
    Computer Graphics continues to provide an outstanding and comprehensive
    introduction to basic computer graphic technology and theory. It retains an
    informal and intuitive style while improving precision, consistency, and
    completeness of material, allowing aspiring and experienced graphics
    programmers to better understand and apply foundational principles to the
    development of efficient code in creating film, game, or web designs. Key
    Features Provides a thorough treatment of basic and advanced topics in
    current graphics algorithms Explains core principles intuitively, with
    numerous examples and pseudo-code Gives updated coverage of the graphics
    pipeline, signal processing, texture mapping, graphics hardware, reflection
    models, and curves and surfaces Uses color images to give more illustrative
    power to concepts.

  abstract: >-
    The literature on strategy formation is in large part theoretical but not
    empirical, and the usual definition of “strategy” encourages the notion that
    strategies, as we recognize them ex post facto, are deliberate plans
    conceived in advance of the making of specific decisions. By defining a
    strategy as “a pattern in a stream of decisions,” we are able to research
    strategy formation in a broad descriptive context. Specifically, we can
    study both strategies that were intended and those that were, realized
    .despite intentions. A research program suggested by this definition is
    outlined, and two of the completed studies are then reviewed—the strategies
    of Volkswagenwerk from 1934 to 1974 and of the United States government in
    Vietnam from 1950 to 1973. Some general conclusions suggested by these
    studies are then presented in terms of three central themes: that strategy
    formation can fruitfully be viewed as the interplay between a dynamic
    environment and bureaucratic momentum, with leadership mediating between...

    Thoroughly updated, this fourth edition focuses on modern techniques used to
    generate synthetic three-dimensional images in a fraction of a second. With
    the advent of programmable shaders, a wide variety of new algorithms have
    arisen and evolved over the past few years. This edition discusses current,
    practical rendering methods used in games and other applications. It also
    presents a solid theoretical framework and relevant mathematics for the
    field of interactive computer graphics, all in an approachable style. New to
    this edition: new chapter on VR and AR as well as expanded coverage of
    Visual Appearance, Advanced Shading, Global Illumination, and Curves and
    Curved Surfaces" -- From the publisher.

    We study the motion of charged particles constrained to arbitrary
    two-dimensional curved surfaces but interacting in three-dimensional space
    via the Coulomb potential. To speed-up the interaction calculations, we use
    the parallel compute capability of the Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture
    (CUDA) of todays graphics boards. The particles and the curved surfaces are
    shown using the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL). The paper is intended to
    give graduate students, who have basic experiences with electrostatics and
    the Lagrangian formalism, a deeper understanding in charged particle
    interactions and a short introduction how to handle a many particle system
    using parallel computing on a single home computer.

    An online colour-naming experiment was designed and developed to determine a
    broad set of colour words in wide cultural use with their corresponding
    colour ranges in sRGB and Munsell specifications. The quality of the English
    dataset was analysed in terms of colour centroids, frequency of names,
    consistency and response time. The importance of basic colour terms was
    confirmed while it was also revealed that in free colour naming tasks, the
    majority of the observers preferred to use non-basic colour terms. The
    validation of the web-based experimental methodology with previous studies
    conducted in controlled viewing conditions produced satisfactory results,
    while a comparison of the 27 most frequent chromatic colour words with a
    previous web-based experiment showed a remarkable agreement.

  abstract: >-
    Internet voting continues to enjoy wide interest from both research and
    practice. Among the Internet voting schemes developed over the last decades,
    JCJ / Civitas stands out from the masses due to its innovative approach to
    resist voter coercion. To achieve its ambitious goal, the scheme builds upon
    particularly restrictive assumptions and an abstract credential handling
    rendering the scheme impractical for real-world use. At ARES 2012, Neumann
    and Volkamer presented a proposal which implements several of these
    assumptions (voter-side assumptions) and the credential handling by the use
    of smart cards. While addressing these practical shortcomings of JCJ /
    Civitas, their proposal did not take performance into account, and
    accordingly its performance has not been evaluated. In the present work, we
    revise the ARES proposal from a performance perspective in a
    security-invariant manner. Based on the herein proposed revisions, we are
    able to conclude that the revised ARES proposal is feasible to be used in
    real-world elections.

    The question of how an effective and efficient communi- cation system can
    emerge in a population of agents that need to solve a particular task
    attracts more and more attention from researchers in many fields, including
    artificial intelligence, linguistics and sta- tistical physics. A common
    methodology for studying this question consists of carrying out multi-agent
    experiments in which a popu- lation of agents takes part in a series of
    scripted and task-oriented communicative interactions, called ‘language
    games’. While each in- dividual language game is typically played by two
    agents in the pop- ulation, a large series of games allows the population to
    converge on a shared communication system. Setting up an experiment in which
    a rich system for communicating about the real world emerges is a major
    enterprise, as it requires a variety of software components for running
    multi-agent experiments, for interacting with sensors and ac- tuators, for
    conceptualising and interpreting semantic structures, and for mapping
    between these semantic structures and linguistic utter- ances. The aim of
    this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it introduces a high-level robot
    interface that extends the Babel software system, presenting for the first
    time a toolkit that provides flexible modules for dealing with each subtask
    involved in running advanced grounded language game experiments. On the
    other hand, it provides a practi- cal guide to using the toolkit for
    implementing such experiments, taking a grounded colour naming game
    experiment as a didactic example.

    This report presents a brief and simple introduction to the motion of
    charged particles in the Earth's magnetosphere. Separated into three parts,
    the first portion goes over the structure of the magnetosphere, including
    plasma regions, field morphology and general modeling schemes. The second
    section addresses the simulation of relativistic charged- particle
    trajectories such as the governing equations of motion and the available
    motion solvers. Finally, the last component of this article discusses the
    projects, exploring wave- particle resonances, undertaken during the UTRIP
    2013 summer research program.

    The expressions for electron paths in various types of undulators with and
    without axial magnetic field Bz are given, Bz is usually applied for
    transporting high-current beams of electrons with rather low energy. Also,
    expressions are derived for the transverse velocity acquired by electrons in
    stray fields of undulators, and after they have passed the adiabatic entry
    of undulators with various forms of field increase (Bz = 0 or Bz ≠ 0).
    Transverse electron velocities can also arise from space charge and current
    forces of the beam in stationary transport conditions and in transition
    regions where the cross section of a transport channel varies. The possible
    effects are also evaluated.

    Russian color naming was explored in a web-based experiment. The purpose was
    3-fold: to examine (1) CIELAB coordinates of centroids for 12 Russian basic
    color terms (BCTs), including 2 Russian terms for “blue”, sinij “dark blue”,
    and goluboj “light blue”, and compare these with coordinates for the 11
    English BCTs obtained in earlier studies; (2) frequent nonBCTs; and (3)
    gender differences in color naming. Native Russian speakers participated in
    the experiment using an unconstrained color-naming method. Each participant
    named 20 colors, selected from 600 colors densely sampling the Munsell Color
    Solid. Color names and response times of typing onset were registered.
    Several deviations between centroids of the Russian and English BCTs were
    found. The 2 “Russian blues”, as expected, divided the BLUE area along the
    lightness dimension; their centroids deviated from a centroid of English
    blue. Further minor departures were found between centroids of Russian and
    English counterparts of “brown” and “red”. The Russian color inventory
    confirmed the linguistic refinement of the PURPLE area, with high
    frequencies of nonBCTs. In addition, Russian speakers revealed elaborated
    naming strategies and use of a rich inventory of nonBCTs. Elicitation
    frequencies of the 12 BCTs were comparable for both genders; however,
    linguistic segmentation of color space, employing a synthetic observer,
    revealed gender differences in naming colors, with more refined naming of
    the “warm” colors from females. We conclude that, along with universal
    perceptual factors, that govern categorical partition of color space,
    Russian speakers’ color naming reflects language-specific factors,
    supporting the weak relativity hypothesis.

    Reading a text without spaces in an alphabetic language causes disruption at
    the levels of word identiﬁcation and eye movement control. In the present
    experiment, we examined how word discriminability affects the pattern of eye
    movements when reading unspaced text in an alphabetic language. More
    speciﬁcally, we designed an experiment in which participants read three
    types of sentences: normally written sentences, regular unspaced sentences,
    and alternatingbold unspaced sentences. Although there was a reading cost in
    the unspaced sentences relative to the normally written sentences, this cost
    was much smaller in alternatingbold unspaced sentences than in regular
    unspaced sentences.

  abstract: >-
    This thesis presents “cache-oblivious” algorithms that use asymptotically
    optimal amounts of work, and move data asymptotically optimally among
    multiple levels of cache. An algorithm is cache oblivious if no program
    variables dependent on hardware configuration parameters, such as cache size
    and cache-line length need to be tuned to minimize the number of cache
    misses. We show that the ordinary algorithms for matrix transposition,
    matrix multi- plication, sorting, and Jacobi-style multipass filtering are
    not cache optimal. We present algorithms for rectangular matrix
    transposition, FFT, sorting, and multi- pass filters, which are
    asymptotically optimal on computers with multiple levels of caches.

    If you design and develop products for people, this book is for you. The
    Persona Lifecycle addresses the “how of creating effective personas and
    using those personas to design products that people love. It doesn’t just
    describe the value of personas; it offers detailed techniques and tools
    related to planning, creating, communicating, and using personas to create
    great product designs. Moreover, it provides rich examples, samples, and
    illustrations to imitate and model. Perhaps most importantly, it positions
    personas not as a panacea, but as a method used to complement other
    user-centered design (UCD) techniques including scenario-based design,
    cognitive walkthroughs and user testing. John Pruitt is the User Research
    Manager for the Tablet & Mobile PC Division at Microsoft Corporation. Tamara
    Adlin is a Customer Experience Manager at Amazon.com. For the past six
    years, John and Tamara have been researching and using personas, leading
    workshops, and teaching courses at professional conferences and
    universities. They developed the Persona Lifecycle model to communicate the
    value and practical application of personas to product design and

    In this paper, we report on a fast second-order numerical integrator to
    solve the Lorentz force equations of a relativistic charged particle in
    electromagnetic fields. This numerical integrator shows less numerical error
    than the popular Boris algorithm in tracking the relativistic particle
    subject to electric and magnetic space-charge fields and requires less
    number of operations than another recently proposed relativistic integrator.

    See your offering through the buyer's eyes for more effective marketing
    Buyer Personas is the marketer's actionable guide to learning what your
    buyer wants and how they make decisions. Written by the world's leading
    authority on buyer personas, this book provides comprehensive coverage of a
    compelling new way to conduct buyer studies, plus practical advice on
    adopting the buyer persona approach to measurably improve marketing
    outcomes. Readers will learn how to segment their customer base, investigate
    each customer type, and apply a radically more relevant process of message
    selection, content creation, and distribution through the channels that earn
    the buyers' trust. Rather than relying on generic data or guesswork to
    determine what the buyer wants, the buyer persona approach allows companies
    to ask the buyer directly and obtain more precise and actionable guidance.
    Buyer personas are composite pictures of the people who buy solutions,
    services or products, crafted through a unique type of interview with the
    people the marketer wants to influence. This book provides step-by-step
    guidance toward implementing the buyer persona approach, with the advice of
    an internationally-respected expert. Learn who buys what, and why Understand
    your buyer's goals and how you can address them Tailor your marketing
    activities to your buyer's expectations See the purchase through the
    customer's eyes A recent services industry survey reports that 52 percent of
    their marketers have buyer personas, and another 28 percent expect to add
    them within the next two years – but only 14.6 percent know how to use them.
    To avoid letting such a valuable tool go to waste, access the expert
    perspective in Buyer Personas, and craft a more relevant marketing strategy.

    The PhD thesis focuses on the coordination of technology-intensive
    innovation activities at both sector and firm levels, supported by the use
    of the strategic roadmapping method. Investigations combine qualitative and
    quantitative research methods; using a narrative approach in the form of
    interviews to uncover innovation and technology barriers, and a social
    network analysis of stakeholders’ role in relation to two technology
    platforms during a five-year period when the roadmaps 2020 were developed.
    In this respect, the thesis emphasizes the view of innovation as an
    interactive process to develop competences among technology users,
    producers, research institutions, and politicians. As a result, knowledge on
    how the platforms evolved, and their dynamics, provide new reflections on
    the innovation systems approach: that connectivity seems to change along the
    changes in problem. This is how the players create new knowledge. Thus, the
    identification of political and technical barriers is important selection
    mechanisms in how connectivity grows and changes. The thesis, furthermore,
    includes practical experience and account of roadmap development at the firm
    level providing reflections on dynamic capabilities. Understanding
    roadmapping has been a journey in this research showing that there is no
    ‘one size fits all’. Rather the strength of roadmapping lies in the
    participatory process and in the action-oriented, systematic framework that
    aligns layers of information while moving from a current position to a
    desired future.

  abstract: >-
    Starting from the Lagrangian of a charged particle in an electromagnetic
    field, the Hamiltonian for non-linear coupled synchro-betatron oscillations
    of ultra-relativistic charged particles (protons) is derived. The canonical
    variables are x, Px• z, p20 o, n which are well-known from the six
    dimensional linear theory (SLIM). Keeping only terms up to second order in
    the canonical momenta Px, p2 , the equations of motion are then solved for
    various kinds of magnets (quadrupole, skew quadrupole, bending magnet,
    synchrotron-magnet, solenoid, sextupole, octupole, dipole kicker) and for
    cavities, taking into account the effect of energy deviation on the focusing
    strength. The equations so derived can serve to develope a non-linear, six
    dimensional (symplectic) tracking program for ultra-relativistic protons.

  abstract: >-
    We compare relativistic particle integrators commonly used in plasma
    physics, showing several test cases relevant for astrophysics. Three
    explicit particle pushers are considered, namely, the Boris, Vay, and
    Higuera–Cary schemes. We also present a new relativistic fully implicit
    particle integrator that is energy conserving. Furthermore, a method based
    on the relativistic guiding center approximation is included. The algorithms
    are described such that they can be readily implemented in
    magnetohydrodynamics codes or Particle-in-Cell codes. Our comparison focuses
    on the strengths and key features of the particle integrators. We test the
    conservation of invariants of motion and the accuracy of particle drift
    dynamics in highly relativistic, mildly relativistic, and non-relativistic
    settings. The methods are compared in idealized test cases, i.e., without
    considering feedback onto the electrodynamic ﬁelds, collisions, pair
    creation, or radiation. The test cases include uniform electric and magnetic
    ﬁelds, E ´ B ﬁelds, force-free ﬁelds, and setups relevant for high-energy
    astrophysics, e.g., a magnetic mirror, a magnetic dipole, and a magnetic
    null. These tests have direct relevance for particle acceleration in shocks
    and in magnetic reconnection.

    Strategic Project Management uses real life case examples to characterize
    and describe the organizational factors and conditions necessary for
    projects to thrive and to deliver the organization's strategic objectives.
    This characterization is formed around ten imperatives which senior managers
    can implement - both within individual projects and, even more crucially,
    within the institutions that sponsor them - using the tools provided.
    Accessible, practical and free of jargon, Strategic Project Management
    offers the solutions needed to successfully prioritize and manage a
    portfolio of projects, communicate aims, align priorities to organizational
    objectives, evaluate progress, manage supplier relationships and anticipate
    and mitigate the risks at every stage. Supported by a comprehensive package
    of online resources for project portfolio planning, management and analysis
    this book will help readers to build on their skills, knowledge and
    confidence to rise to the challenge of governing and delivering successful
    projects.

    Technology roadmapping (TRM) is gaining momentum as a strategic management
    tool for an organization to integrate technology into business strategy.
    This paper reviews over a hundred of TRM related publications to provide the
    community with the current state of roadmapping researches and practices.
    From the literature, the issue of keeping a roadmap alive is identified as
    the key challenge in the field. To address this challenge,
    operationalization and effective implementation of TRM are emphasized as
    potential areas for future research.

    There are many articles on how to construct a persona that represents your
    target audience. However, little attention is ever paid to the actual naming
    of these fictitious people. It is simply human nature to want to name
    things. If instead of calling our high school student persona "Martha" we
    just called her "Student Persona 11A" it wouldn't have the same impact. Just
    like real people, names matter and can influence the success or failure of
    your personas.

  abstract: >-
    When Fortune Magazine estimated that 70% of all strategies fail, it also
    noted that most of these strategies were basically sound, but could not be
    executed. The central premise of Strategic Project Management Made Simple is
    that most projects and strategies never get off the ground because of adhoc,
    haphazard, and obsolete methods used to turn their ideas into coherent and
    actionable plans. Strategic Project Management Made Simple is the first book
    to couple a step-by-step process with an interactive thinking tool that
    takes a strategic approach to designing projects and action initiatives.
    Strategic Project Management Made Simple builds a solid platform upon four
    critical questions that are vital for teams to intelligently answer in order
    to create their own strong, strategic foundation. These questions are: 1.
    What are we trying to accomplish and why? 2. How will we measure success? 3.
    What other conditions must exist? 4. How do we get there? This fresh
    approach begins with clearly understanding the what and why of a project -
    comprehending the bigger picture goals that are often given only lip service
    or cursory reviews. The second and third questions clarify success measures
    and identify the risky assumptions that can later cause pain if not spotted
    early. The how questions - what are the activities, budgets, and schedules -
    comes last in our four-question system. By contrast, most project approaches
    prematurely concentrate on the how without first adequately addressing the
    three other questions. These four questions guide readers into fleshing out
    a simple, yet sophisticated, mental workbench called "the Logical Framework"
    - a Systems Thinking paradigm that lays out one's own project strategy in an
    easily accessible, interactive 4x4 matrix. The inclusion of memorable
    features and concepts (four critical questions, LogFrame matrix, If-then
    thinking, and Implementation Equation) make this book unique.

  abstract: >-
    The main goal of the book is to provide a systematic and didactic approach
    to the physics and technology of free-electron lasers. Numerous figures are
    used for illustrating the underlying ideas and concepts and links to other
    fields of physics are provided. After an introduction to undulator radiation
    and the low-gain FEL, the one-dimensional theory of the high-gain FEL is
    developed in a systematic way. Particular emphasis is put on explaining and
    justifying the various assumptions and approximations that are needed to
    obtain the differential and integral equations governing the FEL dynamics.
    Analytical and numerical solutions are presented and important FEL
    parameters are defined, such as gain length, FEL bandwidth and saturation
    power. One of the most important features of a high-gain FEL, the formation
    of microbunches, is studied at length. The increase of gain length due to
    beam energy spread, space charge forces, and three-dimensional effects such
    as betatron oscillations and optical diffraction is analyzed. The mechanism
    of Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission is described theoretically and
    illustrated with numerous experimental results. Various methods of FEL
    seeding by coherent external radiation are introduced, together with
    experimental results. The world’s first soft X-ray FEL, the user facility
    FLASH at DESY, is described in some detail to give an impression of the
    complexity of such an accelerator-based light source. The last chapter is
    devoted to the new hard X-ray FELs which generate extremely intense
    radiation in the Angstrøm regime. The appendices contain supplementary
    material and more involved calculations.

    This paper presents the development of ontologies for OntoPersonaURM, an
    Ontology-Based Persona-Driven User Requirements Modeling model, with goal of
    providing insights into the construction of ontologies for explicit
    specifications of the concept of persona in representing users’ knowledge
    and characteristics, and the concepts of viewpoints, goals, scenarios,
    tasks, and requirements for Web application domain. OntoPersonaURM is
    composed of three interrelated ontologies: Persona Ontology, Behavioral-GST
    (Behavioral-Goal-Scenario-Task) Ontology, and Requirements Ontology. The
    objectives are to examine 1) how the concept of persona, in the context of
    the concepts of viewpoint, goal, scenario, task, and requirement, may be
    integrated in a unified environment and 2) how the concepts and their
    relationships may be specified ontologically. The explicit specifications of
    concepts and their relationships in the developed ontologies serve to
    establish a knowledge repository and foster common understanding of users’
    needs and behaviors among developers and stakeholders during the
    requirements analysis and modeling activity. We provide a running example of
    a university course registration web application domain to demonstrate the
    OntoPersonaURM model, consisting of UML class diagrams and explicit
    specifications of the concepts of the ontologies in the Protégé-Frames
    ontology knowledge management environment.

    Road map:”1: a map showing roads especially for automobile travel. 2. a : a
    detailed plan to guide progress toward a goal; b: a detailed explanation.
    (MeriamWebster.com Dictionary, 2008)

    The roadmap we use for navigating in the car, bringing us from A to B,
    showing alternative routes, provides a strong metaphor (Meyer, 1984;
    Cornelissen, 2005) for a

    roadmap used by practitioners. – Strategy is a journey, purposes are
    destinations, means are

    routes, and achievements are landmarks. - Strategic dialogues and
    conversations with this

    figure of speech do not only cover linguistical aspects but in a broad view
    cover a complex,

    information-rich mix of auditory, visual, olfactory, and tactile events (
    Ford & Ford, 1995). In

    roadmapping the visual mapping of contributions of the participants is
    assumed to be crucial.

    Metaphors of roadmaps inspired numerous practitioners, to execute a
    roadmapping process.

    Maps and strategic dialogues in roadmapping are assumed to be interrelated.
    In our research

    we explored the wealth of clarifications and explanations that have been put
    forward by

    roadmapping practioners in their publications for the purpose of
    establishing and exchanging

    best practices such as Industry networks EIRMA in Europe (Groenveld, 1997;
    Phaal ea, 2008;

    Mohrle & Isenmann, 2005) and SEMATECH in the US (Browning, ea., 1995;
    Burgelman,

    2002). We reviewed twelve stories with anecdotic evidence of roadmapping
    practice at

    global firms like Motorola, Philips, Lucent, Siemens, Honneywell etc.
    (Willyard & McClees,

    1984; Groenveld, 1997; Albright & Kappel,2003; Farrokhzad et.al., 2005;
    Whalen, 2007 ). In this paper we captured their insights, deducted,
    confronted and joined these with

    existing theory concepts of Innovation, Design and Strategic literature. By
    inductive research

    we have built concepts and found that visuals are of key importance. Visual
    attributes are

    grounded in the concept of a roadmap. And visual mapping is of key
    importance in the

    consensus building dialogue of roadmapping. In this short paper our
    qualitative findings and

    reflection are presented.

    In the first part of this presentation we will take a brief look at the
    tremendous growth in computational power that is ongoing, from desktop
    machines to high performance computing hardware. It will come as no surprise
    to this audience that computational power has grown very quickly and
    continues to grow very quickly. The availability of all this power allows us
    to solve problems much faster. This means we can solve larger problems
    involving more complex and more realistic models. It allows us to solve
    problems we probably would not have even considered
    tryingtosolveyearsago,becauseoftheircomputationaldemands.
    Allofthishasmadepossible significant advances in many fields of science and
    engineering. But, another thing we can use all this computer power for, that
    is often overlooked in the quest to solve problems faster and faster, is
    that we can use it to solve problems more reliably—in fact to actually
    provide mathematical and computational guarantees of reliability. So in the
    second part of this presentation we will focus on issues of reliability—what
    good is high performance computing if we are just computing the wrong answer
    faster?

    You know what's even better than playing games? Programming your own! Make
    your own online games, even if you're an absolute beginner. Let your
    imagination come to 3D life as you learn real-world programming skills with
    the JavaScript programming language - the language used everywhere on the
    web. This new edition is completely revised, and takes advantage of new
    programming features to make game programming even easier to learn. Plus,
    new effects make your games even cooler. When you're done, you're going to
    be amazed at what you can create. Jump right in! Start programming cool
    stuff on page 1. Keep building new and different things until the very last
    page. This book wants you to play. Not just play games, but play with code.
    Play with programming. Because the best way to learn something is to have
    fun with it! This second edition is updated from start to finish to make it
    even easier to get started programming in JavaScript. Every example has been
    updated to make it easier, with new example games to explore and new 3D
    effects that make your games even more fun! Want a red donut? You can make
    hundreds of them, spinning around like mad. Want to create a star field?
    Make a hundred or a thousand stars. Make them red, green, or blue.
    Explosions? Fireworks? Planets? It's up to you. And, using a code editor
    created especially for this book, you'll program right in your web browser.
    You'll see the results of your work and imagination right away - right next
    to the code that you just typed! Along the way, you'll pick up a ton of
    programming knowledge, and dive in even deeper with some more advanced
    chapters. Whatever you want to do, this book has your back. Best of all, you
    get to create awesome games and say, "I made this!" You need the latest
    version of the Google Chrome Web browser, available for free from
    https://chrome.google.com. You also need an Internet connection to access
    the ICE Code Editor the first time. ICE Code Editor will be loaded onto your
    computer, so you won't need Internet access for later projects

    von entscheidender Bedeutung. Sie ist eine Angelegenheit von Leben und Tod,
    eine Straße, die zur Sicherheit oder in den Untergang führt. Deshalb darf
    sie unter keinen Umständen vernachlässigt werden.

  abstract: >-
    An important part of electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations is
    the time integration scheme. The large number of particles used in plasma
    simu- lation impose the usage of an efficient method with low memory
    consumption. A popular integrator is the Boris-Buneman method, also utilized
    in the Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library (OPAL) at the Paul
    Scherrer Institut. Until now, constant time steps are applied to carry the
    simulation forward in time. In this thesis we investigate whether adapting
    solely the global time step, used for moving all particles, can provide
    enhanced efficiency. We make an ex- cursion into the world of adaptive
    methods and propose an adaptive variant of the Boris-Buneman method. First
    tests with a prototype implementation in OPAL show promising results,
    despite the rather simple way how the time step is adapted.

    We describe quantum protocols for voting and surveying. A key feature of our
    schemes is the use of entangled states to ensure that the votes are
    anonymous and to allow the votes to be tallied. The entanglement is
    distributed over separated sites; the physical inaccessibility of any one
    site is sufficient to guarantee the anonymity of the votes. The security of
    these protocols with respect to various kinds of attack is discussed. We
    also discuss classical schemes and show that our quantum voting protocol
    represents a N-fold reduction in computational complexity, where N is the
    number of voters.

    This paper addresses the numerical issues related to the modeling of beams
    or plasmas crossing at relativistic velocity using the Particle-In-Cell
    method. Issues related to the use of the standard Boris particle pusher are
    identiﬁed and a novel pusher which circumvents them is proposed, whose
    eﬀectiveness is demonstrated on single particle tests. A procedure for
    solving the ﬁelds is proposed, which retains electrostatic, magnetostatic
    and inductive ﬁeld eﬀects in the direction of the mean velocity of the
    species, is fully explicit and simpler than the full Darwin approximation.
    Finally, results are given, from a calculation using the novel features, of
    an ultra-relativistic beam interacting with a background of electrons.

    The research question is “How can firms approach synchronization in
    strategic planning?”, aiming to investigate opportunities for improved
    synchronization within strategic planning. The focus is on roadmapping, as a
    relatively simple, flexible and widely used method that includes time as an
    explicit dimension. The adopted methodology is a process approach,
    consisting of literature review, exploratory interviews, practitioner
    interviews, and case studies with large multinational firms based in the UK
    that are familiar with roadmapping. As a result, four types of
    synchronization have been identified and discussed, including generic forms
    of each type, illustrated with industrial examples from the case studies.

    This new edition gives project managers practical methods and tools to make
    the right decisions while juggling multiple objectives, risks and
    uncertainties, and stakeholders. Project management requires you to navigate
    a maze of multiple and complex decisions that are an everyday part of the
    job. To be effective, you must know how to make rational choices with your
    projects, what processes can help to improve these choices, and what tools
    are available to help you with decision-making. An entertaining and
    easy-to-read guide to a structured project decision-making process, Project
    Decisions will help you identify risks and perform basic quantitative and
    qualitative risk and decision analyses. Lev Virine and Michael Trumper use
    their understanding of basic human psychology to show you how to use event
    chain methodology, establish creative business environments, and estimate
    project time and costs. Each phase of the process is described in detail,
    including a review of both its psychological aspects and quantitative
    methods.

    Particle Accelerator Physics is an in-depth and comprehensive introduction
    to the field of high-energy particle acceleration and beam dynamics. Part I
    gathers the basic tools, recalling the essentials of electrostatics and
    electrodynamics as well as of particle dynamics in electromagnetic fields.
    Part II is an extensive primer in beam dynamics, followed in Part III by the
    introduction and description of the main beam parameters. Part IV is devoted
    to the treatment of perturbations in beam dynamics. Part V discusses the
    details of charged particle acceleration. Part VI and Part VII introduce the
    more advanced topics of coupled beam dynamics and the description of very
    intense beams. Part VIII is an exhaustive treatment of radiation from
    accelerated charges and introduces important sources of coherent radiation
    such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers. Part IX collects the
    appendices gathering useful mathematical and physical formulae, parameters
    and units. Solutions to many end-of-chapter problems are given. This
    textbook is suitable for an intensive two-semester course starting at the
    advanced undergraduate level.

    A charged particle accelerator is a complex machine that takes elementary
    charged particles and accelerates them to very high energies.  Accelerator
    physics is a field of physics encompassing all the aspects required to
    design and operate the equipment and to understand the resulting dynamics of
    the charged particles.  There are software packages associated with each
    such domain. There are a large number of such codes. The 1990 edition of the
    Los Alamos Accelerator Code Group's compendium  provides summaries of more
    than 200 codes. Certain of those codes are still in use today although many
    are obsolete. Another index of existing and historical accelerator
    simulation codes is located at

    Over 70 recipes that cover advanced techniques for 3D programming such as
    lighting, shading, textures, particle systems, and image processing with
    OpenGL 4.6 Key Features Explore techniques for implementing shadows using
    shadow maps and shadow volumes Learn to use GLSL features such as compute,
    geometry, and tessellation shaders Use GLSL to create a wide variety of
    modern, realistic visual effects Book Description OpenGL 4 Shading Language
    Cookbook, Third Edition provides easy-to-follow recipes that first walk you
    through the theory and background behind each technique, and then proceed to
    showcase and explain the GLSL and OpenGL code needed to implement them. The
    book begins by familiarizing you with beginner-level topics such as
    compiling and linking shader programs, saving and loading shader binaries
    (including SPIR-V), and using an OpenGL function loader library. We then
    proceed to cover basic lighting and shading effects. After that, you'll
    learn to use textures, produce shadows, and use geometry and tessellation
    shaders. Topics such as particle systems, screen-space ambient occlusion,
    deferred rendering, depth-based tessellation, and physically based rendering
    will help you tackle advanced topics. OpenGL 4 Shading Language Cookbook,
    Third Edition also covers advanced topics such as shadow techniques
    (including the two of the most common techniques: shadow maps and shadow
    volumes). You will learn how to use noise in shaders and how to use compute
    shaders. The book provides examples of modern shading techniques that can be
    used as a starting point for programmers to expand upon to produce modern,
    interactive, 3D computer-graphics applications. What you will learn Compile,
    debug, and communicate with shader programs Use compute shaders for physics,
    animation, and general computing Learn about features such as shader storage
    buffer objects and image load/store Utilize noise in shaders and learn how
    to use shaders in animations Use textures for various effects including cube
    maps for reflection or refraction Understand physically based reflection
    models and the SPIR-V Shader binary Learn how to create shadows using shadow
    maps or shadow volumes Create particle systems that simulate smoke, fire,
    and other effects Who this book is for If you are a graphics programmer
    looking to learn the GLSL shading language, this book is for you. A basic
    understanding of 3D graphics and programming experience with C++ are
    required.

    In an era of dynamic and turbulent environment, organizations have to stand
    face to high and unexpected competitions. Knowledge Management plays a
    critical role, helps organizations to deeply understand the rapidly changing
    world and withstand threats, while investing opportunities. This is not
    attainable unless the organization develops its strategies based on a robust
    but flexible conceptual business structure that updates itself with the
    changing variables of environments. Strategy is often defined as a unique
    plan of action designed to achieve a specific goal. Planning is a
    cornerstone of strategic thinking of work, whether short or long-range plan.
    The organization needs a strategic plan to succeed. This plan is considered
    as a collection of blueprints, schedules, information, facts, opinions, and
    knowledge to create a business model to give a clear and specific vision for
    the organization. Every organization requires a group of experts to design
    its strategic plan. This plan is meant to improve and enhance skills and
    capabilities of the organization, to build the general compatible model, and
    to fit with other models throughout the world in order to achieve the
    organization goals. Ontology is the most important element for building the
    knowledge tree and creating the business model. For this purpose, this
    research is aiming to develop a state of the art Strategic Business Ontology
    Model that helps organizations think strategically and adapt to change
    swiftly.

    In Estonian Parliamentary elections held in 2011, the percentage of Internet
    voters among all the voters was as high as 24.3%. At the same time a student
    implemented a proof-of-concept malware which demonstrated the effective
    disenfranchisement of the voter from the right to vote. The chapter gives an
    overview of risk assessment and threat modeling of Estonian Internet voting
    after the events of 2011. The chapter presents a classification of attacks
    against the voting method, distinguishing between manipulation attacks,
    revocation attacks and attacks towards public confidence.
