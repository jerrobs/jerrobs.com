    "abstract": "Many sophisticated computer models have been developed to understand the behaviour of particle accelerators. Even these complex models often do not describe the measured data. Interactions of the beam with external fields, other particles in the same beam and the beam walls all present modelling challenges. These can be challenging to model correctly even with modern supercomputers. This paper describes OPAL (Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library), a parallel open source tool for charged-particle optics in linear accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge. OPAL is built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that high performance computing is the third leg of science, complementing theory and experiment. Using the MAD language with extensions, OPAL can run on a laptop as well as on the largest high performance computing systems. The OPAL framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes, enabling the modelling of many physics processes and field types. OPAL comes in two flavours: OPAL-cycl: tracks particles with 3D space charge including neighbouring turns in cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the independent variable. OPAL-t: models beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors and complete XFELs excluding the undulator. The code is managed through the git distributed version control system. A suite of unit tests have been developed for various parts of OPAL, validating each part of the code independently. System tests validate the overall integration of different elements.",

    "abstract": "Context. Particle systems and particle effects are used to simulate a realistic and appealing atmosphere in many virtual environments. However, they do occupy a significant amount of computational resources. The demand for more advanced graphics increases by each generation, likewise does particle systems need to become increasingly more detailed. Objectives. This thesis proposes a texture-based 3D vector field particle system, computed on the Graphics Processing Unit, and compares it to an equation-based particle system. Methods. Several tests were conducted comparing different situations and parameters for the methods. All of the tests measured the computational time needed to execute the different methods. Results. We show that the texture-based method was effective in very specific situations where it was expected to outperform the equation-based. Otherwise, the equation-based particle system is still the most efficient. Conclusions. Generally the equation-based method is preferred, except for in very specific cases. The texture-based is most efficient to use for static particle systems and when a huge number of forces is applied to a particle system. Texture-based vector fields is hardly useful otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Graphics Shaders: Theory and Practice is intended for a second course in computer graphics at the undergraduate or graduate level, introducing shader programming in general, but focusing on the GLSL shading language. While teaching how to write programmable shaders, the authors also teach and reinforce the fundamentals of computer graphics. The second edition has been updated to incorporate changes in the OpenGL API (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0) and also has a chapter on the new tessellation shaders, including many practical examples. The book starts with a quick review of the graphics pipeline, emphasizing features that are rarely taught in introductory courses, but are immediately exposed in shader work. It then covers shader-specific theory for vertex, tessellation, geometry, and fragment shaders using the GLSL 4.x0 shading language. The text also introduces the freely available glman tool that enables you to develop, test, and tune shaders separately from the applications that will use them. The authors explore how shaders can be used to support a wide variety of applications and present examples of shaders in 3D geometry, scientific visualization, geometry morphing, algorithmic art, and more. Features of the Second Edition: Written using the most recent specification releases (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0) including code examples brought up-to-date with the current standard of the GLSL language. More examples and more exercises A chapter on tessellation shaders An expanded Serious Fun chapter with examples that illustrate using shaders to produce fun effects A discussion of how to handle the major changes occurring in the OpenGL standard, and some C++ classes to help you manage that transition The authors thoroughly explain the concepts, use sample code to describe details of the concepts, and then challenge you to extend the examples. They provide sample source code for many of the book’s examples at www.cgeducation.org",

    "abstract": "This chapter describes learning electromagnetism with visualizations and focuses on the value of concrete and visual representations in teaching abstract concepts. We start with a theoretical background consisting of three subsections: visualization in science, simulations and microcomputer-based laboratory, and studies that investigated the effectiveness of simulations and real-time graphing in physics. We then present the TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) project for MIT's introductory electromagnetism course as a case in point. We demonstrate the various types of visualizations and how they are used in the TEAL classroom. A description of a large-scale study at MIT follows. In this study, we investigated the effects of introducing 2D and 3D visualizations into an active learning setting on learning outcomes in both the cognitive and affective domains. We conclude by describing an example of TEAL classroom discourse, which demonstrates the effects and benefits of the TEAL project in general, and the active learning and visualizations in particular.",

Master the complex competitive features needed in modern games such as Volumetric Lightmaps and Precomputed Lighting on Volumetric Fog, and build an impressive UI. Experience not only VR support for your game but also the inbuilt support of Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore with UE4's newly released support for these platforms. Book Description To make a basic combat game from scratch, you will quickly override existing UE4 classes, and add and implement simple C++ functions while running and building them. These are all discussed as a short summary for new developers and as a quick refresher for experienced developers. Next, you will build a combat player character with expanded controls, create logic for a character, swap weapons, attack and move, bridge over scene changes and transitions, retain data between scenes, and manage the scene-change process. You will then build an intelligent enemy AI and add physics based particles for weapon impacts. You will also get acquainted with cutting-edge features such as Volumetric Lightmaps for precomputed lighting, and Atmospheric and Volumetric Fog, to build advanced visuals in our ongoing GitHub project. Moving on, you will explore the tools required to build an in-game cut-scene for a more professional gameplay experience and story direction. Along the way, you will implement a solid game UI, including writing a full in-game load and save system that will enable players to resume their game from any point. You will also prepare, build, and work on VR and AR taking them from editor to real-world, building two new projects one in each of these brand new areas of UE4 and integrate classes from the main project into AR! By the end of the book, you will have mastered all major UE features and will be able to bring self-imagined games to life through Unreal Engine 4.18+.

This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems.

    "abstract": "It's time to stop thinking that shaders are magical. You can use shaders to turn data into stunning visual effects, and get your hands dirty by building your own shader with this step-by-step introduction to shader development for game and graphics developers. Learn how to make shaders that move, tint, light up, and look awesome, all without cracking open a math textbook. Practical Shader Development teaches the theory behind how shaders work. The book also shows you how to apply that theory to create eye-popping visual effects. You'll learn to profile and optimize those effects to make sure your projects keep running quickly with all their new visuals. You'll learn good theory, good practices, and without getting bogged down in the math. Author Kyle Halladay explains the fundamentals of shader development through simple examples and hands-on experiments. He teaches you how to find performance issues in shaders you are using and then how to fix them. Kyle explains (and contrasts) how to use the knowledge learned from this book in three of the most popular game engines today. What You'll Learn Understand what shaders are and how they work Get up to speed on the nuts and bolts of writing vertex and fragment shaders Utilize color blending and know how blend equations work Know the coordinate spaces used when rendering real-time computer graphics Use simple math to animate characters, simulate lights, and create a wide variety of visual effects Find and fix performance problems in shaders See how three popular game engines (Unity, UE4, Godot) handle shaders Who This Book Is For Programmers who are interested in writing their own shaders but do not know where to start, anyone who has ever seen shader code on a forum and wished they knew how to modify it just a little bit to fit into their own projects, and game developers who are tired of using the default shaders found in the game engines they are using. The book is especially useful for those who have been put off by existing shader tutorials which introduce complex math and graphics theory before ever getting something on the screen.",

One of few resources available that distills the best practices of the community of CUDA programmers, this second edition contains 100% new material of interest across industry, including finance, medicine, imaging, engineering, gaming, environmental science, and green computing. It covers new tools and frameworks for productive GPU computing application development and provides immediate benefit to researchers developing improved programming environments for GPUs. Divided into five sections, this book explains how GPU execution is achieved with algorithm implementation techniques and approaches to data structure layout. More specifically, it considers three general requirements: high level of parallelism, coherent memory access by threads within warps, and coherent control flow within warps. Chapters explore topics such as accelerating database searches; how to leverage the Fermi GPU architecture to further accelerate prefix operations; and GPU implementation of hash tables. There are also discussions on the state of GPU computing in interactive physics and artificial intelligence; programming tools and techniques for GPU computing; and the edge and node parallelism approach for computing graph centrality metrics. In addition, the book proposes an alternative approach that balances computation regardless of node degree variance. Software engineers, programmers, hardware engineers, and advanced students will find this book extremely useful. This second volume of GPU Computing Gems offers 100% new material of interest across industry, including finance, medicine, imaging, engineering, gaming, environmental science, green computing, and more Covers new tools and frameworks for productive GPU computing application development and offers immediate benefit to researchers developing improved programming environments for GPUs Even more hands-on, proven techniques demonstrating how general purpose GPU computing is changing scientific research Distills the best practices of the community of CUDA programmers; each chapter provides insights and ideas as well as 'hands on' skills applicable to a variety of fields",

    "abstract": "Elegant is an accelerator physics and particle-beam dynamics code widely used for modeling and design of a variety of high-energy particle accelerators and accelerator-based systems. We discuss a recently developed version of the code that can take advantage of CUDA-enabled graphics processing units (GPUs) to achieve significantly improved performance for a large class of simulations that are important in practice. The GPU version is largely defined by a framework that simplifies implementations of the fundamental kernel types that are used by Elegant: particle operations, reductions, particle loss, histograms, array convolutions and random number generation. Accelerated performance on the Titan Cray XK-7 supercomputer is approximately 6–10 times better with the GPU than all the CPU cores associated with the same node count. In addition to performance, the maintainability of the GPU-accelerated version of the code was considered a key design objective. Accuracy with respect to the CPU implementation is also a core consideration. Finally, four different methods are used to ensure that the accelerated code faithfully reproduces the CPU results.",

Not long ago, there existed some unsolved problems pertaining to stencil shadows that prevented the algorithm from working correctly under various conditions. Advances have now been made, however, so that stencil shadows can be robustly implemented to handle arbitrarily positioned point lights and infinite directional lights having any desired spatial relationship with the camera. This article presents the intricacies of the entire stencil shadow algorithm and covers every mathematical detail of its efficient implementation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we extend the concept of pre-ﬁltered shadow mapping to stochastic rasterization, enabling real-time rendering of soft shadows from planar area lights. Most existing soft shadow mapping methods lose important visibility information by relying on pinhole renderings from an area light source, providing plausible results only for small light sources. Since we sample the entire 4D shadow light ﬁeld stochastically, we are able to closely approximate shadows of large area lights as well. In order to efﬁciently reconstruct smooth shadows from this sparse data, we exploit the analogy of soft shadow computation to rendering defocus blur, and introduce a multiplane pre-ﬁltering algorithm. We demonstrate how existing pre-ﬁlterable approximations of the visibility function, such as variance shadow mapping, can be extended to four dimensions within our framework.",

To speed-up the interaction calculations, we use the parallel compute capability of the Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture (CUDA) of todays graphics boards. The particles and the curved surfaces are shown using the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL). The paper is intended to give graduate students, who have basic experiences with electrostatics and the Lagrangian formalism, a deeper understanding in charged particle interactions and a short introduction how to handle a many particle system using parallel computing on a single home computer.",

Separated into three parts, the first portion goes over the structure of the magnetosphere, including plasma regions, field morphology and general modeling schemes. The second section addresses the simulation of relativistic charged- particle trajectories such as the governing equations of motion and the available motion solvers. Finally, the last component of this article discusses the projects, exploring wave- particle resonances, undertaken during the UTRIP 2013 summer research program.",

Also, expressions are derived for the transverse velocity acquired by electrons in stray fields of undulators, and after they have passed the adiabatic entry of undulators with various forms of field increase (Bz = 0 or Bz ≠ 0). Transverse electron velocities can also arise from space charge and current forces of the beam in stationary transport conditions and in transition regions where the cross section of a transport channel varies. The possible effects are also evaluated.",

An algorithm is cache oblivious if no program variables dependent on hardware configuration parameters, such as cache size and cache-line length need to be tuned to minimize the number of cache misses. We show that the ordinary algorithms for matrix transposition, matrix multi- plication, sorting, and Jacobi-style multipass filtering are not cache optimal. We present algorithms for rectangular matrix transposition, FFT, sorting, and multi- pass filters, which are asymptotically optimal on computers with multiple levels of caches.",

Keeping only terms up to second order in the canonical momenta Px, p2 , the equations of motion are then solved for various kinds of magnets (quadrupole, skew quadrupole, bending magnet, synchrotron-magnet, solenoid, sextupole, octupole, dipole kicker) and for cavities, taking into account the effect of energy deviation on the focusing strength.

    "abstract": "We compare relativistic particle integrators commonly used in plasma physics, showing several test cases relevant for astrophysics. Three explicit particle pushers are considered, namely, the Boris, Vay, and Higuera–Cary schemes. We also present a new relativistic fully implicit particle integrator that is energy conserving. Furthermore, a method based on the relativistic guiding center approximation is included. The algorithms are described such that they can be readily implemented in magnetohydrodynamics codes or Particle-in-Cell codes. Our comparison focuses on the strengths and key features of the particle integrators. We test the conservation of invariants of motion and the accuracy of particle drift dynamics in highly relativistic, mildly relativistic, and non-relativistic settings. The methods are compared in idealized test cases, i.e., without considering feedback onto the electrodynamic ﬁelds, collisions, pair creation, or radiation. The test cases include uniform electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E ´ B ﬁelds, force-free ﬁelds, and setups relevant for high-energy astrophysics, e.g., a magnetic mirror, a magnetic dipole, and a magnetic null. These tests have direct relevance for particle acceleration in shocks and in magnetic reconnection.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of the book is to provide a systematic and didactic approach to the physics and technology of free-electron lasers. Numerous figures are used for illustrating the underlying ideas and concepts and links to other fields of physics are provided. After an introduction to undulator radiation and the low-gain FEL, the one-dimensional theory of the high-gain FEL is developed in a systematic way. Particular emphasis is put on explaining and justifying the various assumptions and approximations that are needed to obtain the differential and integral equations governing the FEL dynamics. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented and important FEL parameters are defined, such as gain length, FEL bandwidth and saturation power. One of the most important features of a high-gain FEL, the formation of microbunches, is studied at length. The increase of gain length due to beam energy spread, space charge forces, and three-dimensional effects such as betatron oscillations and optical diffraction is analyzed. The mechanism of Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission is described theoretically and illustrated with numerous experimental results. Various methods of FEL seeding by coherent external radiation are introduced, together with experimental results. The world’s first soft X-ray FEL, the user facility FLASH at DESY, is described in some detail to give an impression of the complexity of such an accelerator-based light source. The last chapter is devoted to the new hard X-ray FELs which generate extremely intense radiation in the Angstrøm regime. The appendices contain supplementary material and more involved calculations.",

    "abstract": "In the first part of this presentation we will take a brief look at the tremendous growth in computational power that is ongoing, from desktop machines to high performance computing hardware. It will come as no surprise to this audience that computational power has grown very quickly and continues to grow very quickly. The availability of all this power allows us to solve problems much faster. This means we can solve larger problems involving more complex and more realistic models. It allows us to solve problems we probably would not have even considered tryingtosolveyearsago,becauseoftheircomputationaldemands. Allofthishasmadepossible significant advances in many fields of science and engineering. But, another thing we can use all this computer power for, that is often overlooked in the quest to solve problems faster and faster, is that we can use it to solve problems more reliably—in fact to actually provide mathematical and computational guarantees of reliability. So in the second part of this presentation we will focus on issues of reliability—what good is high performance computing if we are just computing the wrong answer faster?",

    "abstract": "An important part of electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations is the time integration scheme. The large number of particles used in plasma simu- lation impose the usage of an efficient method with low memory consumption. A popular integrator is the Boris-Buneman method, also utilized in the Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library (OPAL) at the Paul Scherrer Institut. Until now, constant time steps are applied to carry the simulation forward in time. In this thesis we investigate whether adapting solely the global time step, used for moving all particles, can provide enhanced efficiency. We make an ex- cursion into the world of adaptive methods and propose an adaptive variant of the Boris-Buneman method. First tests with a prototype implementation in OPAL show promising results, despite the rather simple way how the time step is adapted.",

Issues related to the use of the standard Boris particle pusher are identiﬁed and a novel pusher which circumvents them is proposed, whose eﬀectiveness is demonstrated on single particle tests. A procedure for solving the ﬁelds is proposed, which retains electrostatic, magnetostatic and inductive ﬁeld eﬀects in the direction of the mean velocity of the species, is fully explicit and simpler than the full Darwin approximation. Finally, results are given, from a calculation using the novel features, of an ultra-relativistic beam interacting with a background of electrons.",

The book begins by familiarizing you with beginner-level topics such as compiling and linking shader programs, saving and loading shader binaries (including SPIR-V), and using an OpenGL function loader library. We then proceed to cover basic lighting and shading effects. After that, you'll learn to use textures, produce shadows, and use geometry and tessellation shaders. Topics such as particle systems, screen-space ambient occlusion, deferred rendering, depth-based tessellation, and physically based rendering will help you tackle advanced topics. OpenGL 4 Shading Language Cookbook, Third Edition also covers advanced topics such as shadow techniques (including the two of the most common techniques: shadow maps and shadow volumes). You will learn how to use noise in shaders and how to use compute shaders. The book provides examples of modern shading techniques that can be used as a starting point for programmers to expand upon to produce modern, interactive, 3D computer-graphics applications. What you will learn Compile, debug, and communicate with shader programs Use compute shaders for physics, animation, and general computing Learn about features such as shader storage buffer objects and image load/store Utilize noise in shaders and learn how to use shaders in animations Use textures for various effects including cube maps for reflection or refraction Understand physically based reflection models and the SPIR-V Shader binary Learn how to create shadows using shadow maps or shadow volumes Create particle systems that simulate smoke, fire, and other effects Who this book is for If you are a graphics programmer looking to learn the GLSL shading language, this book is for you. A basic understanding of 3D graphics and programming experience with C++ are required.",
