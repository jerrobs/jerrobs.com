description: >
  Strategy is a dangerous term. Physically dangerous for its roots in military planning: Whenever a _strategos_ of the Hellenistic world devised a strategy to handle affairs with you, you damn well better be prepared for a brute force attack. And conceptually dangerous for its multidisciplinary use without acknowledging its multiple meanings. Don't let too many cooks spoil the broth.

## Introduction

This review examines how authors from very different domains understand strategy. The main aim is to identify commonalities and differences in order to help develop an understanding that is compatible across disciplines.

## 1. Strategy in Military and in Political Life

The word _strategy_ has its roots in the Greek for the officer rank of general, _strategos_. It was used as early as in Ancient Greece and is still employed in the modern Hellenic Army.

### Sun Tzu (771 BC - 256 BC)

However, it was not a Greek author who first developed the concept. Instead, it was the Chinese military general and writer Sun Tzu who is credited as the author of the oldest known military treatise, The Art of War. Written around 500 BC, the text contains hundreds of rules and recommendations. One of these rules is the distinction between strategy and tactics:

> All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved. <cite class="md">(@suntzu__2004__kunst)</cite>

> Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory

> </cite>

### Carl von Clausewitz (1780 - 1831)

While Sun Tzu called for the use of minimum force with a greater emphasis on deception, the father of modern Western military study, Carl von Clausewitz, recommended the use of maximum force whenever possible.

According to Clausewitz military strategy is

> the employment of battles to gain the end of war.

> Die Kriegsführung nun ist also die Anordnung und Führung des Kampfes. Wäre dieser Kampf ein einzelner Akt, so würde kein Grund zu einer weiteren Einteilung sein; allein der Kampf besteht aus einer mehr oder weniger groBen Zahl einzelner, in sich geschlossener Akte, die wir Gefechte nennen [...] und die neue Einheiten bilden. Daraus entspringt nun die ganz verschiedene Tätigkeit, diese Gefechte in sich anzuordnen und zu führen und sie unter sich zum Zweck des Krieges zu verbinden. Das eine ist die Taktik, das andere die Strategie genannt worden. [...] Es ist also nach unserer Einteilung die Taktik die Lehre vom Gebrauch der Streitkräfte im Gefecht, die Strategie die Lehre vom Gebrauch der Gefechte zum Zweck des Krieges.

> [W]ar is not an exercise of the will directed at inanimate matter, as is the case with the mechanical arts, or at matter which is animate but passive and yielding, as is the case with the human mind and emotions in the fine arts. In war, the will is directed at an animate object that reacts.

## 2. Strategy in Game Theory

A game is simply the set of rules that describe it. Every particular instance in which the game is played -- in a particular way -- from beginning to end is a game. Elements of a game are moves, which are occasions of choice between various alternatives, to be made either by one of the players or by some device subject to chance, under conditions precisely prescribed by the rules of the game. The specific alternative chosen in a concrete case, i.e. in a concrete game, is the choice. The moves are thus related to the choices in the same way as the game is related to the play. The game consists of
of a sequence of moves and the game of a sequence of choices.

> Now imagine that each player _k_ = 1, ... , n, instead of making each decision as the need arises, makes up his mind in advance for all possible contingencies; i.e. that the player _k_ begins to play with a complete plan: a plan which specifies what choices he will make in every possible situation, for every possible actual information which he may have at that moment, in accordance with the pattern of information which the rules of the game provide for him for that case. <mark>We call such a plan a _strategy_.</mark>

## 3. Strategy in Software Engineering

Closely related to the strategy concept in game theory is the _strategy design pattern_ in software engineering. The idea of design patterns was introduced by architect Christopher Alexander (<BibRef refId="alexander_ishikawa_etal__1977__pattern" />) to describe solution templates that have proven useful for solving a set of similar problems in the past. The idea was first applied to software engineering in 1994 (<BibRef refId="gamma_helm_etal__1994__design" />).

The strategy pattern can be used when different algorithms are available to solve a task, but it is context dependent which algorithm to choose. Rather than pre-selecting and hard-coding a single algorithm, the strategy pattern implements multiple algorithms in such a way that they can be easily interchanged at a later point in time.

> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This strategy allows the algorithm to vary independently of the clients that use it.

Gamma et al. illustrate the strategy pattern with the line-breaking problem in typography. To break a long string into lines, there are several algorithms to choose from: the simplest is one that greedily fills line after line with as many words as possible; more sophisticated is the Knuth-Plaas method used in the typesetting software TeX, which minimises the variation in line length per paragraph (<BibRef refId="knuth_plass__1981__breaking" />). Adobe InDesign allows the user to choose between the two strategies at runtime.

## Strategy in Management Theory

Also: Corporate Strategy, Business Strategy

The application of the concept of strategy in applied economics has arguably contributed more than any other field to its widespread use, and a never-ending stream of literature. Due to the strong application orientation, one looks in vain here for an examination of the term on an abstract level. The fact that the lack of such a conceptual foundation is not an end in itself is shown perfectly in that very few authors take the trouble to distinguish between the set of all conceivable strategies and concrete subtypes or manifestations.

### Porter

Strategy is the set of long term choices that organisation makes to distinguish itself from competitors. Strategy defines a company's distinctive approach to competing, and the competitive advantages on which it will be based.

#### Five forces

In 1979, Porter identified five forces to be considered when analysing competition in a particular industry and thus to be considered when developing a strategic response <BibRef refId="porter__1979__what" /> <BibRef refId="porter__2008__five" />.

- Threat of new entrants
- Bargaining power of suppliers
- Bargaining power of buyers
- Threat of substitute products or services
- Rivalry among existing competitors }

#### Three generic strategies

In 1985, Porter introduced the concept of _generic strategies_ of which he makes out three: the Cost Leadership Strategy, the Differentiation Strategy, and the Focus Strategy. <BibRef refId="porter__1985__competitive" />

### Implicit strategies

In addition to the rational planning of strategies, Henry Mintzberg explicitly mentions the possibility of emergent strategies that have not been written down anywhere, but have developed out of the enterprise itself. <BibRef refId="mintzberg__1978__patterns" />

### Freedman

Here: <BibRef refId="freedman__2013__strategy" />.

## Summary

Finally, let's try to summarise the different aspects of the concept of _strategy_ covered by the various fields of knowledge.

### aspects

- **Planning**

- When _strategy_ is considered in conjunction with _tactics_, it sits at the very top of the planning hierarchy, above _tactics_. In terms of timeframe, _strategy_ is sometimes conceived of as more long-term than _tactics_.
