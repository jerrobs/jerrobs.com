Strategy is a dangerous term -- physically for its roots in military planning, conceptually for its transdisciplinary use without acknowledging its different meanings.

## Strategy in Military and Politics

The word _strategy_ has its root in the Greek for the officer rank of a general, _strategos_. It was used as early as in Ancient Greece and is still employed in the modern Hellenic Army.

### Sun Tzu (771 BC - 256 BC)

However, it was not a Greek author who first developed the concept. Instead, it was the Chinese military general and writer Sun Tzu who is credited as the author of the oldest known military treatise, The Art of War. Written around 500 BC, the text contains hundreds of rules and recommendations. One of these rules is the distinction between strategy and tactics:


> All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
> <cite class="md"><BibRef refId="suntzu__2004__kunst" locator="Chapter VI, 27" /></cite>

> Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
> <cite class="md"><BibRef refId="suntzu__2004__kunst" locator="Chapter IV, 15"/></cite>



### Carl von Clausewitz (1780 - 1831)


While Sun Tzu called for the use of minimum force with a greater emphasis on cunning, the father of modern Western military study, Carl von Clausewitz, recommended the use of maximum force whenever possible.

According to Clausewitz military strategy is

> the employment of battles to gain the end of war.
> <cite class="md"><BibRef refId="clausewitz__1832__vom" locator=""/></cite>

> Die Kriegsführung nun ist also die Anordnung und Führung des Kampfes. Wäre dieser Kampf ein einzelner Akt, so würde kein Grund zu einer weiteren Einteilung sein; allein der Kampf besteht aus einer mehr oder weniger groBen Zahl einzelner, in sich geschlossener Akte, die wir Gefechte nennen [...] und die neue Einheiten bilden. Daraus entspringt nun die ganz verschiedene Tätigkeit, diese Gefechte in sich anzuordnen und zu führen und sie unter sich zum Zweck des Krieges zu verbinden. Das eine ist die Taktik, das andere die Strategie genannt worden. [...] Es ist also nach unserer Einteilung die Taktik die Lehre vom Gebrauch der Streitkräfte im Gefecht, die Strategie die Lehre vom Gebrauch der Gefechte zum Zweck des Krieges.
> <cite class="md"><BibRef refId="clausewitz__1832__vom" locator="Zweites Buch, Erstes Kapitel"/></cite>

> [W]ar is not an exercise of the will directed at inanimate matter, as is the case with the mechanical arts, or at matter which is animate but passive and yielding, as is the case with the human mind and emotions in the fine arts. In war, the will is directed at an animate object that reacts.

## Strategy in Game Theory

The game is simply the totality of the rules which describe it. Every particular instance at which the game is played – in a particular way – from beginning to end, is a play. Elements of a game are moves which are occasions of choice between various alternatives, to be made either by one of the players, or by some device subject to chance, under conditions precisely prescribed by the rules of the game. The specific alternative chosen in a concrete instance i.e. in a concrete play is the choice. Thus the moves are related to the choices in the same way as the game is to the play. The game consists
of a sequence of moves, and the play of a sequence of choices. 2

> Imagine now that each player _k_ = 1, ... , n, instead of making each decision as the necessity for it arises, makes up his mind in advance for all possible contingencies; i. @ e. that the player _k_ begins to play with a complete plan: a plan which specifies what choices he will make in every possible situation, for every possible actual information which he may possess at that moment in conformity with the pattern of information which the rules of the game provide for him for that case. <mark>We call such a plan a _strategy_.</mark>

## Strategy in Management Theory

Also: Corporate Strategy, Business Strategy

The application of the concept of strategy in applied economics has arguably contributed more than any other field to its widespread use, and a never-ending stream of literature. Due to the strong application orientation, one looks in vain here for an examination of the term on an abstract level. The fact that the lack of such a conceptual foundation is not an end in itself is shown perfectly in that very few authors take the trouble to distinguish between the set of all conceivable strategies and concrete subtypes or manifestations.

### Porter

Strategy is the set of long term choices that organisation makes to distinguish itself from competitors. Strategy defines a company's distinctive approach to competing, and the competitive advantages on which it will be based.


{/* 
Strategy is not:

- Strategy is different from aspirations
  - <del>Our strategy is to be number 1 in our field / industry</del>
  - <del>Our strategy is to grow</del>
- Strategy is more than particular actions
  - <del>Our strategy is to merge</del>
  - <del>Our strategy is to cut costs</del>
- Strategy is not the same as mission / values
  - <del>Out strategy is to save our customers and communities while meeting the highest standards of integrity</del>
- Strategy is not operational excellence

Strategy is ...

- ... about unique value proposition
- ... about choice (what to do and what not to)
- ... about tradeoffs

#### Five forces

In 1979, Porter identified five forces to be considered when analysing competition in a particular industry and thus to be considered when developing a strategic response <BibRef refId="porter__1979__what" /> <BibRef refId="porter__2008__five" />.

- Threat of new entrants
- Bargaining power of suppliers
- Bargaining power of buyers
- Threat of substitute products or services
- Rivalry among existing competitors */}

#### Three generic strategies

In 1985, Porter introduced the concept of _generic strategies_ of which he makes out three: the Cost Leadership Strategy, the Differentiation Strategy, and the Focus Strategy. <BibRef refId="porter__1985__competitive" />


### Implicit strategies

In addition to the rational planning of strategies, Henry Mintzberg explicitly mentions the possibility of emergent strategies that have not been written down anywhere, but have developed out of the enterprise itself. <BibRef refId="mintzberg__1978__patterns" />

## Strategy in Software Engineering

Closely related to the strategy concept in game theory is the _strategy design pattern_ in software engineering. Design patterns are reusable templates for solving general problems, introduced by architect Christopher Alexander (<BibRef refId="alexander_ishikawa_etal__1977__pattern" />) and first applied to software engineering in 1994 (<BibRef refId="gamma_helm_etal__1994__design" />).

The strategy pattern can be used when different algorithms are available to solve a problem. Instead of hard-coding a single algorithm directly, the code receives instructions at runtime as to which algorithm from a family of algorithms to use.

Gamma et al. illustrate the strategy pattern with the line breaking problem. To break a long string into lines, one has a couple of different algorithms to choose from: The simplest is one that greedily fills line after line with as many words as possible; more sophisticated is the Knuth-Plaas method used in the typesetting software TeX, which minimizes the variation in line lengths per paragraph (<BibRef refId="knuth_plass__1981__breaking" />). In Adobe InDesign, the user can choose between the two strategies at runtime.

## Summary


Finally, let's try to summarise the different aspects of the concept of _strategy_ covered by the various fields of knowledge.

### aspects

* **Planning**


* When _strategy_ is considered in conjunction with _tactics_, it sits at the very top of the planning hierarchy, above _tactics_. In terms of timeframe, _strategy_ is sometimes conceived of as more long-term than _tactics_.
