  abstract: >-
    The Sustainable Development Report 2022 features the SDG Index and
    Dashboards, the first and widely used tool to assess country performance on
    the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. In a context of
    multiple crises, the report analyzes and outlines how the SDGs can be used
    as a roadmap for more sustainable societies by 2030 and beyond. In
    particular, this year's edition underlines the importance of international
    financing mechanisms for addressing lack of fiscal space in poorer countries
    and promoting sustainable investments into physical and human
    infrastructure. The authors examine country performance on the SDGs for 193
    countries using a wide array of indicators, and calculate future
    trajectories, presenting a number of best practices to achieve the historic
    Agenda 2030. The views expressed in this report do not reflect the views of
    any organization, agency or program of the United Nations. This title is
    available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.
