  abstract: >-
    This report presents a brief and simple introduction to the motion of
    charged particles in the Earth's magnetosphere. Separated into three parts,
    the first portion goes over the structure of the magnetosphere, including
    plasma regions, field morphology and general modeling schemes. The second
    section addresses the simulation of relativistic charged- particle
    trajectories such as the governing equations of motion and the available
    motion solvers. Finally, the last component of this article discusses the
    projects, exploring wave- particle resonances, undertaken during the UTRIP
    2013 summer research program.
