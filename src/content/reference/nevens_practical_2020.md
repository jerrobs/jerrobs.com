  abstract: >-
    The question of how an effective and efficient communi- cation system can
    emerge in a population of agents that need to solve a particular task
    attracts more and more attention from researchers in many fields, including
    artificial intelligence, linguistics and sta- tistical physics. A common
    methodology for studying this question consists of carrying out multi-agent
    experiments in which a popu- lation of agents takes part in a series of
    scripted and task-oriented communicative interactions, called ‘language
    games’. While each in- dividual language game is typically played by two
    agents in the pop- ulation, a large series of games allows the population to
    converge on a shared communication system. Setting up an experiment in which
    a rich system for communicating about the real world emerges is a major
    enterprise, as it requires a variety of software components for running
    multi-agent experiments, for interacting with sensors and ac- tuators, for
    conceptualising and interpreting semantic structures, and for mapping
    between these semantic structures and linguistic utter- ances. The aim of
    this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it introduces a high-level robot
    interface that extends the Babel software system, presenting for the first
    time a toolkit that provides flexible modules for dealing with each subtask
    involved in running advanced grounded language game experiments. On the
    other hand, it provides a practi- cal guide to using the toolkit for
    implementing such experiments, taking a grounded colour naming game
    experiment as a didactic example.
