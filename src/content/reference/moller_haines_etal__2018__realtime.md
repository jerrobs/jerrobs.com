    Thoroughly updated, this fourth edition focuses on modern techniques used to
    generate synthetic three-dimensional images in a fraction of a second. With
    the advent of programmable shaders, a wide variety of new algorithms have
    arisen and evolved over the past few years. This edition discusses current,
    practical rendering methods used in games and other applications. It also
    presents a solid theoretical framework and relevant mathematics for the
    field of interactive computer graphics, all in an approachable style. New to
    this edition: new chapter on VR and AR as well as expanded coverage of
    Visual Appearance, Advanced Shading, Global Illumination, and Curves and
    Curved Surfaces" -- From the publisher.
