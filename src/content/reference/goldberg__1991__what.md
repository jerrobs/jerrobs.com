  abstract: >-
    Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by many people.
    This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer
    systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from
    PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will
    be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and
    virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions
    such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of
    floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems.
    It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding
    error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and
    concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support
    floating point.
