  abstract: >-
    "When Stanley Morison wrote in First Principles of Typography that
    "Typography does not so much need Inspiration or Revival as Investigation,"
    he may well have had Geoffrey Dowding in mind. Few people investigate,
    dissect and care about type with the passion and intensity of Dowding. He
    probes into every aspect & use of type and space, from word and letter
    arrangement to the design of type itself. He's readable, absorbing and
    provocative; no matter how you feel about Geoffrey Dowding's opinions, you
    will never approach design in quite the same way after having read Finer
    Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type. If you care about design and
    the printed word, then you care about what Geoffrey Dowding has to
    say."â€“BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America,
