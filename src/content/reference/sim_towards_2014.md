    This paper presents the development of ontologies for OntoPersonaURM, an
    Ontology-Based Persona-Driven User Requirements Modeling model, with goal of
    providing insights into the construction of ontologies for explicit
    specifications of the concept of persona in representing users’ knowledge
    and characteristics, and the concepts of viewpoints, goals, scenarios,
    tasks, and requirements for Web application domain. OntoPersonaURM is
    composed of three interrelated ontologies: Persona Ontology, Behavioral-GST
    (Behavioral-Goal-Scenario-Task) Ontology, and Requirements Ontology. The
    objectives are to examine 1) how the concept of persona, in the context of
    the concepts of viewpoint, goal, scenario, task, and requirement, may be
    integrated in a unified environment and 2) how the concepts and their
    relationships may be specified ontologically. The explicit specifications of
    concepts and their relationships in the developed ontologies serve to
    establish a knowledge repository and foster common understanding of users’
    needs and behaviors among developers and stakeholders during the
    requirements analysis and modeling activity. We provide a running example of
    a university course registration web application domain to demonstrate the
    OntoPersonaURM model, consisting of UML class diagrams and explicit
    specifications of the concepts of the ontologies in the Protégé-Frames
    ontology knowledge management environment.
