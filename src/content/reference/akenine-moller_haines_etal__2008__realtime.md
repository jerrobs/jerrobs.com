    Thoroughly revised, this third edition focuses on modern techniques used to
    generate synthetic three-dimensional images in a fraction of a second. With
    the advent of programmable shaders, a wide variety of new algorithms have
    arisen and evolved over the past few years. This edition discusses current,
    practical rendering methods used in games and other applications. It also
    presents a solid theoretical framework and relevant mathematics for the
    field of interactive computer graphics, all in an approachable style. The
    authors have made the figures used in the book available for download for
    fair use.:Download Figures.
