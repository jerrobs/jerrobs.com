    The main goal of the book is to provide a systematic and didactic approach
    to the physics and technology of free-electron lasers. Numerous figures are
    used for illustrating the underlying ideas and concepts and links to other
    fields of physics are provided. After an introduction to undulator radiation
    and the low-gain FEL, the one-dimensional theory of the high-gain FEL is
    developed in a systematic way. Particular emphasis is put on explaining and
    justifying the various assumptions and approximations that are needed to
    obtain the differential and integral equations governing the FEL dynamics.
    Analytical and numerical solutions are presented and important FEL
    parameters are defined, such as gain length, FEL bandwidth and saturation
    power. One of the most important features of a high-gain FEL, the formation
    of microbunches, is studied at length. The increase of gain length due to
    beam energy spread, space charge forces, and three-dimensional effects such
    as betatron oscillations and optical diffraction is analyzed. The mechanism
    of Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission is described theoretically and
    illustrated with numerous experimental results. Various methods of FEL
    seeding by coherent external radiation are introduced, together with
    experimental results. The world’s first soft X-ray FEL, the user facility
    FLASH at DESY, is described in some detail to give an impression of the
    complexity of such an accelerator-based light source. The last chapter is
    devoted to the new hard X-ray FELs which generate extremely intense
    radiation in the Angstrøm regime. The appendices contain supplementary
    material and more involved calculations.
