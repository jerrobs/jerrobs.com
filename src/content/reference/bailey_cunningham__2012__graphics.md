    Graphics Shaders: Theory and Practice is intended for a second course in
    computer graphics at the undergraduate or graduate level, introducing shader
    programming in general, but focusing on the GLSL shading language. While
    teaching how to write programmable shaders, the authors also teach and
    reinforce the fundamentals of computer graphics. The second edition has been
    updated to incorporate changes in the OpenGL API (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0)
    and also has a chapter on the new tessellation shaders, including many
    practical examples. The book starts with a quick review of the graphics
    pipeline, emphasizing features that are rarely taught in introductory
    courses, but are immediately exposed in shader work. It then covers
    shader-specific theory for vertex, tessellation, geometry, and fragment
    shaders using the GLSL 4.x0 shading language. The text also introduces the
    freely available glman tool that enables you to develop, test, and tune
    shaders separately from the applications that will use them. The authors
    explore how shaders can be used to support a wide variety of applications
    and present examples of shaders in 3D geometry, scientific visualization,
    geometry morphing, algorithmic art, and more. Features of the Second
    Edition: Written using the most recent specification releases (OpenGL 4.x
    and GLSL 4.x0) including code examples brought up-to-date with the current
    standard of the GLSL language. More examples and more exercises A chapter on
    tessellation shaders An expanded Serious Fun chapter with examples that
    illustrate using shaders to produce fun effects A discussion of how to
    handle the major changes occurring in the OpenGL standard, and some C++
    classes to help you manage that transition The authors thoroughly explain
    the concepts, use sample code to describe details of the concepts, and then
    challenge you to extend the examples. They provide sample source code for
    many of the bookâ€™s examples at www.cgeducation.org
