    The Sustainable Development Report (including the SDG Index & Dashboards) is
    a complement to the official SDG indicators and voluntary country-led review
    processes. The report is not an official monitoring tool. It uses publicly
    available data published by official data providers (World Bank, WHO, ILO,
    others) and other organizations including research centers and
    non-governmental organizations. Interest in the global SDG Index and
    Dashboards has spurred many initiatives to develop localized assessments of
    SDG progress.
