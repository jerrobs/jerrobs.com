  abstract: >-
    Many sophisticated computer models have been developed to understand the
    behaviour of particle accelerators. Even these complex models often do not
    describe the measured data. Interactions of the beam with external fields,
    other particles in the same beam and the beam walls all present modelling
    challenges. These can be challenging to model correctly even with modern
    supercomputers. This paper describes OPAL (Object Oriented Parallel
    Accelerator Library), a parallel open source tool for charged-particle
    optics in linear accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge. OPAL is
    built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact
    that high performance computing is the third leg of science, complementing
    theory and experiment. Using the MAD language with extensions, OPAL can run
    on a laptop as well as on the largest high performance computing systems.
    The OPAL framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++
    classes, enabling the modelling of many physics processes and field types.
    OPAL comes in two flavours: OPAL-cycl: tracks particles with 3D space charge
    including neighbouring turns in cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the
    independent variable. OPAL-t: models beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors
    and complete XFELs excluding the undulator. The code is managed through the
    git distributed version control system. A suite of unit tests have been
    developed for various parts of OPAL, validating each part of the code
    independently. System tests validate the overall integration of different
    elements.
