    We study the motion of charged particles constrained to arbitrary
    two-dimensional curved surfaces but interacting in three-dimensional space
    via the Coulomb potential. To speed-up the interaction calculations, we use
    the parallel compute capability of the Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture
    (CUDA) of todays graphics boards. The particles and the curved surfaces are
    shown using the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL). The paper is intended to
    give graduate students, who have basic experiences with electrostatics and
    the Lagrangian formalism, a deeper understanding in charged particle
    interactions and a short introduction how to handle a many particle system
    using parallel computing on a single home computer.
