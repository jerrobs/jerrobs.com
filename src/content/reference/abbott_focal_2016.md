  abstract: >-
    Focal colors, or best examples of color terms, have traditionally been
    viewed as either the underlying source of cross-language color-naming
    universals or derived from category boundaries that vary widely across
    languages. Existing data partially support and partially challenge each of
    these views. Here, we advance a position that synthesizes aspects of these
    two traditionally opposed positions and accounts for existing data. We do so
    by linking this debate to more general principles. We show that best
    examples of named color categories across 112 languages are well-predicted
    from category extensions by a statistical model of how representative a
    sample is of a distribution, independently shown to account for patterns of
    human inference. This model accounts for both universal tendencies and
    variation in focal colors across languages. We conclude that categorization
    in the contested semantic domain of color may be governed by principles that
    apply more broadly in cognition and that these principles clarify the
    interplay of universal and language-specific forces in color naming.
