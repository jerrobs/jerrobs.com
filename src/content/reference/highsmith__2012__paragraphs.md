    Inside Paragraphs is about what goes on inside a paragraph of printed text.
    The goal is to help students train their eyes to see text as typographers
    do. It begins with general explanations of how type works and how we read.
    Then the author steps through the different kinds of space within a
    paragraph. Finally, it puts everything together with a discussion about
    paragraph settings. Typography began with paragraphs of printed text. Since
    then, it has evolved in all sorts of directions, sometimes leaving ink and
    paper behind entirely. But the printed paragraph is still a good starting
    point. Understanding what goes on inside provides a solid foundation on
    which to build. And that's what this book is meant to be -- a foundation.
    Inside Paragraphs is the book Highsmith always wanted when he was a student
    in his first typography course.
