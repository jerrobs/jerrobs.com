    This paper investigates how strategy formulation and implementation
    processes used by the University of Cape Coast (UCC) in building its digital
    collections compare with the Andrew’s strategic formulation and
    implementation theoretical framework. Theory-testing case study methodology
    was used. The data collection instruments were the key informant interview
    technique and document reviews. During the formulation phase, two aspects
    (resources and aspirations of senior management) were emergent. During the
    implementation phase, five aspects (achieving results, processes and
    behaviour, standards, motivation, personal) were emergent. All other
    elements of building the UCC digital collections were planned during both
    the formulation and implementation phases. Although the emphasis on students
    and learning is laudable and apt, there seems to be lack of focus on
    research support beyond digital collection building, despite the fact that
    research excellence is one of the UCC’s key priorities. Opportunities exist
    for improving feedback mechanisms between the users, digital library staff
    and the university management; and inclusion of social media tools in the
    digital library project. Since only the experience of a single institution
    of higher learning is considered, it cannot be definitively stated that
    strategy formulation and implementation will be similar in every
    institutional context. However, the results provide a basis for academic
    digital libraries to draw lessons from this case. In African public
    universities, there is little earlier research on strategy formulation and
    implementation in digital library management. Strategy formulation and
    implementation is a critical issue for higher education academic libraries
    especially in developing countries like Ghana, due to limited financial
    resources and the rapid change in the information environment during the
    last several decades.
