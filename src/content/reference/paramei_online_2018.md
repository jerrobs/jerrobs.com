    Russian color naming was explored in a web-based experiment. The purpose was
    3-fold: to examine (1) CIELAB coordinates of centroids for 12 Russian basic
    color terms (BCTs), including 2 Russian terms for “blue”, sinij “dark blue”,
    and goluboj “light blue”, and compare these with coordinates for the 11
    English BCTs obtained in earlier studies; (2) frequent nonBCTs; and (3)
    gender differences in color naming. Native Russian speakers participated in
    the experiment using an unconstrained color-naming method. Each participant
    named 20 colors, selected from 600 colors densely sampling the Munsell Color
    Solid. Color names and response times of typing onset were registered.
    Several deviations between centroids of the Russian and English BCTs were
    found. The 2 “Russian blues”, as expected, divided the BLUE area along the
    lightness dimension; their centroids deviated from a centroid of English
    blue. Further minor departures were found between centroids of Russian and
    English counterparts of “brown” and “red”. The Russian color inventory
    confirmed the linguistic refinement of the PURPLE area, with high
    frequencies of nonBCTs. In addition, Russian speakers revealed elaborated
    naming strategies and use of a rich inventory of nonBCTs. Elicitation
    frequencies of the 12 BCTs were comparable for both genders; however,
    linguistic segmentation of color space, employing a synthetic observer,
    revealed gender differences in naming colors, with more refined naming of
    the “warm” colors from females. We conclude that, along with universal
    perceptual factors, that govern categorical partition of color space,
    Russian speakers’ color naming reflects language-specific factors,
    supporting the weak relativity hypothesis.
