    See your offering through the buyer's eyes for more effective marketing
    Buyer Personas is the marketer's actionable guide to learning what your
    buyer wants and how they make decisions. Written by the world's leading
    authority on buyer personas, this book provides comprehensive coverage of a
    compelling new way to conduct buyer studies, plus practical advice on
    adopting the buyer persona approach to measurably improve marketing
    outcomes. Readers will learn how to segment their customer base, investigate
    each customer type, and apply a radically more relevant process of message
    selection, content creation, and distribution through the channels that earn
    the buyers' trust. Rather than relying on generic data or guesswork to
    determine what the buyer wants, the buyer persona approach allows companies
    to ask the buyer directly and obtain more precise and actionable guidance.
    Buyer personas are composite pictures of the people who buy solutions,
    services or products, crafted through a unique type of interview with the
    people the marketer wants to influence. This book provides step-by-step
    guidance toward implementing the buyer persona approach, with the advice of
    an internationally-respected expert. Learn who buys what, and why Understand
    your buyer's goals and how you can address them Tailor your marketing
    activities to your buyer's expectations See the purchase through the
    customer's eyes A recent services industry survey reports that 52 percent of
    their marketers have buyer personas, and another 28 percent expect to add
    them within the next two years â€“ but only 14.6 percent know how to use them.
    To avoid letting such a valuable tool go to waste, access the expert
    perspective in Buyer Personas, and craft a more relevant marketing strategy.
