    Technology roadmapping (TRM) is gaining momentum as a strategic management
    tool for an organization to integrate technology into business strategy.
    This paper reviews over a hundred of TRM related publications to provide the
    community with the current state of roadmapping researches and practices.
    From the literature, the issue of keeping a roadmap alive is identified as
    the key challenge in the field. To address this challenge,
    operationalization and effective implementation of TRM are emphasized as
    potential areas for future research.
