    In this paper, we extend the concept of pre-ﬁltered shadow mapping to
    stochastic rasterization, enabling real-time rendering of soft shadows from
    planar area lights. Most existing soft shadow mapping methods lose important
    visibility information by relying on pinhole renderings from an area light
    source, providing plausible results only for small light sources. Since we
    sample the entire 4D shadow light ﬁeld stochastically, we are able to
    closely approximate shadows of large area lights as well. In order to
    efﬁciently reconstruct smooth shadows from this sparse data, we exploit the
    analogy of soft shadow computation to rendering defocus blur, and introduce
    a multiplane pre-ﬁltering algorithm. We demonstrate how existing
    pre-ﬁlterable approximations of the visibility function, such as variance
    shadow mapping, can be extended to four dimensions within our framework.
