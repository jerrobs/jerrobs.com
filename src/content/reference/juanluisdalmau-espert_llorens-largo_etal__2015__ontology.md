  abstract: >-
    From late 1980s and early twenty-first century, the environment where the
    organizations develop and act, has become increasingly uncertain and
    complex. Under these conditions, organizations have detected the need to
    move towards a more participatory model to address and reduce the
    complexity, based on information and knowledge as core assets to reduce
    environmental uncertainty and thereby ensure better decision-making. This
    new form of governance involves changes in the Strategic Planning process
    that are aligned with the characteristics of the new organizational model.
    Ontologies, as theories of content that allow the formalization of processes
    and knowledge, are a key element in this context. The aim of this paper is
    to formally define an ontology that could be defined in the future using the
    Web Ontology Language (OWL) that meets the standards approved by the World
    Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and that is used to formalize the process of SP,
    as well as the knowledge that is created and flows among the several
    participants in the process.
