    Context. Particle systems and particle effects are used to simulate a
    realistic and appealing atmosphere in many virtual environments. However,
    they do occupy a significant amount of computational resources. The demand
    for more advanced graphics increases by each generation, likewise does
    particle systems need to become increasingly more detailed. Objectives. This
    thesis proposes a texture-based 3D vector field particle system, computed on
    the Graphics Processing Unit, and compares it to an equation-based particle
    system. Methods. Several tests were conducted comparing different situations
    and parameters for the methods. All of the tests measured the computational
    time needed to execute the different methods. Results. We show that the
    texture-based method was effective in very specific situations where it was
    expected to outperform the equation-based. Otherwise, the equation-based
    particle system is still the most efficient. Conclusions. Generally the
    equation-based method is preferred, except for in very specific cases. The
    texture-based is most efficient to use for static particle systems and when
    a huge number of forces is applied to a particle system. Texture-based
    vector fields is hardly useful otherwise.
