    You know what's even better than playing games? Programming your own! Make
    your own online games, even if you're an absolute beginner. Let your
    imagination come to 3D life as you learn real-world programming skills with
    the JavaScript programming language - the language used everywhere on the
    web. This new edition is completely revised, and takes advantage of new
    programming features to make game programming even easier to learn. Plus,
    new effects make your games even cooler. When you're done, you're going to
    be amazed at what you can create. Jump right in! Start programming cool
    stuff on page 1. Keep building new and different things until the very last
    page. This book wants you to play. Not just play games, but play with code.
    Play with programming. Because the best way to learn something is to have
    fun with it! This second edition is updated from start to finish to make it
    even easier to get started programming in JavaScript. Every example has been
    updated to make it easier, with new example games to explore and new 3D
    effects that make your games even more fun! Want a red donut? You can make
    hundreds of them, spinning around like mad. Want to create a star field?
    Make a hundred or a thousand stars. Make them red, green, or blue.
    Explosions? Fireworks? Planets? It's up to you. And, using a code editor
    created especially for this book, you'll program right in your web browser.
    You'll see the results of your work and imagination right away - right next
    to the code that you just typed! Along the way, you'll pick up a ton of
    programming knowledge, and dive in even deeper with some more advanced
    chapters. Whatever you want to do, this book has your back. Best of all, you
    get to create awesome games and say, "I made this!"
