  abstract: >-
    Internet voting continues to raise interest. A large number of Internet
    voting schemes are available, both in use, as well as in research
    literature. While these schemes are all based on different security models,
    most of these models are not adequate for high-stake elections. Furthermore,
    it is not known how to evaluate the understandability of these schemes
    (although this is important to enable voters' trust in the election result).
    Therefore, we propose and justify an adequate security model and criteria to
    evaluate understandability. We also describe an Internet voting scheme,
    Pretty Understandable Democracy, show that it satisfies the adequate
    security model and that it is more understandable than Pretty Good
    Democracy, currently the only scheme that also satisfies the proposed
    security model. Index Terms-Cryptography, Internet Voting, Code Voting,
    Security Model, Understandability
