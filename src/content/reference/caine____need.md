  abstract: >-
    The importance of strategy and strategy construct is not a new phenomenon.
    However as strategy work becomes less tangible, concerns with understanding,
    describing, and managing strategies develops into an increasingly complex
    subject. Current strategy concepts are dispersed and lack integration.
    Moreover, the enablement of modelling practices around strategy concepts
    considering the entire strategy lifecycle are also missing. Consequently,
    this paper focuses on issues with strategy in theory and practice, why a
    strategy ontology is needed and how this can be developed.
