  abstract: >-
    Starting from the Lagrangian of a charged particle in an electromagnetic
    field, the Hamiltonian for non-linear coupled synchro-betatron oscillations
    of ultra-relativistic charged particles (protons) is derived. The canonical
    variables are x, Px• z, p20 o, n which are well-known from the six
    dimensional linear theory (SLIM). Keeping only terms up to second order in
    the canonical momenta Px, p2 , the equations of motion are then solved for
    various kinds of magnets (quadrupole, skew quadrupole, bending magnet,
    synchrotron-magnet, solenoid, sextupole, octupole, dipole kicker) and for
    cavities, taking into account the effect of energy deviation on the focusing
    strength. The equations so derived can serve to develope a non-linear, six
    dimensional (symplectic) tracking program for ultra-relativistic protons.
