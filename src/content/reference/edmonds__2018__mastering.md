    A comprehensive guide with coverage on AudioFX, Particle system, shaders,
    sequencers, and the latest features of Unreal 4.19 that will take your game
    development skills to the next level Key Features Create a high-performance
    Combat game using the essential features of Unreal Engine 4.18+. Master the
    complex competitive features needed in modern games such as Volumetric
    Lightmaps and Precomputed Lighting on Volumetric Fog, and build an
    impressive UI. Experience not only VR support for your game but also the
    inbuilt support of Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore with UE4's newly
    released support for these platforms. Book Description To make a basic
    combat game from scratch, you will quickly override existing UE4 classes,
    and add and implement simple C++ functions while running and building them.
    These are all discussed as a short summary for new developers and as a quick
    refresher for experienced developers. Next, you will build a combat player
    character with expanded controls, create logic for a character, swap
    weapons, attack and move, bridge over scene changes and transitions, retain
    data between scenes, and manage the scene-change process. You will then
    build an intelligent enemy AI and add physics based particles for weapon
    impacts. You will also get acquainted with cutting-edge features such as
    Volumetric Lightmaps for precomputed lighting, and Atmospheric and
    Volumetric Fog, to build advanced visuals in our ongoing GitHub project.
    Moving on, you will explore the tools required to build an in-game cut-scene
    for a more professional gameplay experience and story direction. Along the
    way, you will implement a solid game UI, including writing a full in-game
    load and save system that will enable players to resume their game from any
    point. You will also prepare, build, and work on VR and AR taking them from
    editor to real-world, building two new projects one in each of these brand
    new areas of UE4 and integrate classes from the main project into AR! By the
    end of the book, you will have mastered all major UE features and will be
    able to bring self-imagined games to life through Unreal Engine 4.18+. What
    you will learn The fundamentals of a combat-based game that will let you
    build and work all other systems from the core gameplay: the input,
    inventory, A.I. enemies, U.I., and audio Manage performance tools and
    branching shaders based on platform capabilities in the Material Editor
