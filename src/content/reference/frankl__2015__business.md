    How do executives make decisions? Based on what? Are their decisions
    conscious or unconscious? Can they explain each decision they make? What
    tools can they use to improve their decision-making process? What rules of
    thumb (heuristics) can they use when faced with decision-making challenges?
    These are some of the questions this book is about. During the past 30
    years, as an entrepreneur and senior executive of several medium-sized
    Canadian hi-tech businesses, the author observed his decision-making
    processes to be based either on experience or on advice received from
    colleagues. Seldom were decisions based on formal or informal academic-based
    methods. Discussing decision-making methods with other executives of
    comparable business backgrounds confirms they rely on similar methods when
    looking for solutions to challenging business problems. There is no
    substitute for years of experience in any human endeavour. However, tapping
    into some of the methods and lessons learned from personal experience can
    result in useful principles for others to follow. These principles might be
    useful especially for entrepreneurs interested in building their businesses
    or executives looking for some additional help in acquiring a better
    decision-making mouse-trap.
