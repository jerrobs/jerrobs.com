    Our all time best selling book is now available in a revised and expanded
    second edition. Thinking with Type is the definitive guide to using
    typography in visual communication, from the printed page to the computer
    screen. This revised edition includes forty-eight pages of new content,
    including the latest information on style sheets for print and the web, the
    use of ornaments and captions, lining and non-lining numerals, the use of
    small caps and enlarged capitals, as well as information on captions, font
    licensing, mixing typefaces, and hand lettering. Throughout the book, visual
    examples show how to be inventive within systems of typographic formâ€”what
    the rules are and how to break them. Thinking with Type is a type book for
    everyone: designers, writers, editors, students, and anyone else who works
    with words. The popular online companion to Thinking with Type
    (www.thinkingwithtype.com) has been revised to reflect the new material in
    the second edition.
