  abstract: >-
    Alexander Dierks conceptualizes and applies a more nuanced model of the
    brand purchase funnel. The re-conceptualization builds on a holistic,
    theory-based, and practically applicable set of 10 propositions, which
    capture dynamics of consumers’ contemporary search and decision behavior and
    allow for a more differentiated assessment of brand performance across the
    buying cycle. The model’s value add is investigated based on two
    survey-based studies from the automotive and the electricity industry. Using
    logistic regression analysis, the author uncovers insightful differences in
    the determinants of consumers’ purchase decisions depending on the stage of
    consideration set formation. The findings support the employment of the more
    nuanced funnel in brand management.
