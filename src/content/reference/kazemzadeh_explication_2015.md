  abstract: >-
    Business process modeling is an important aspect of analyzing the needs of a
    modern firm. The models produced are used in diverse ways including
    understanding services delivered to customers, underpinning enterprise
    architecture, explaining future changes and the automation of processes, and
    in defining information technology to support processes. However, there is
    also a diversity of modeling techniques used. This paper is an explication
    of three of the most popular: service blueprinting, business process
    modeling notation (BPMN), and a new approach called process chain network
    (PCN). The paper concludes with future works to better understand how these
    approaches can be used in conjunction. JEL Classifications: M000, M150
