    Road map:”1: a map showing roads especially for automobile travel. 2. a : a
    detailed plan to guide progress toward a goal; b: a detailed explanation.
    (MeriamWebster.com Dictionary, 2008)

    The roadmap we use for navigating in the car, bringing us from A to B,
    showing alternative routes, provides a strong metaphor (Meyer, 1984;
    Cornelissen, 2005) for a

    roadmap used by practitioners. – Strategy is a journey, purposes are
    destinations, means are

    routes, and achievements are landmarks. - Strategic dialogues and
    conversations with this

    figure of speech do not only cover linguistical aspects but in a broad view
    cover a complex,

    information-rich mix of auditory, visual, olfactory, and tactile events (
    Ford & Ford, 1995). In

    roadmapping the visual mapping of contributions of the participants is
    assumed to be crucial.

    Metaphors of roadmaps inspired numerous practitioners, to execute a
    roadmapping process.

    Maps and strategic dialogues in roadmapping are assumed to be interrelated.
    In our research

    we explored the wealth of clarifications and explanations that have been put
    forward by

    roadmapping practioners in their publications for the purpose of
    establishing and exchanging

    best practices such as Industry networks EIRMA in Europe (Groenveld, 1997;
    Phaal ea, 2008;

    Mohrle & Isenmann, 2005) and SEMATECH in the US (Browning, ea., 1995;
    Burgelman,

    2002). We reviewed twelve stories with anecdotic evidence of roadmapping
    practice at

    global firms like Motorola, Philips, Lucent, Siemens, Honneywell etc.
    (Willyard & McClees,

    1984; Groenveld, 1997; Albright & Kappel,2003; Farrokhzad et.al., 2005;
    Whalen, 2007 ). In this paper we captured their insights, deducted,
    confronted and joined these with

    existing theory concepts of Innovation, Design and Strategic literature. By
    inductive research

    we have built concepts and found that visuals are of key importance. Visual
    attributes are

    grounded in the concept of a roadmap. And visual mapping is of key
    importance in the

    consensus building dialogue of roadmapping. In this short paper our
    qualitative findings and

    reflection are presented.
