  abstract: "It is well-known that the electron trajectory in an undulator is influenced by the focusing properties (both horizontal and vertical) of the magnetic field. The approximate solutions of motion equations for electrons in the 3-dimensional magnetic field, which describe these focusing properties, can be found by means of averaging over the short-length oscillations. On the other hand, the equations of motion can be solved numerically, by applying the Runge-Kutta algorithm. It is shown in this paper that numerically computed trajectories\_â€¦"
