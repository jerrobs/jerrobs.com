  abstract: >-
    An important part of electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations is
    the time integration scheme. The large number of particles used in plasma
    simu- lation impose the usage of an efficient method with low memory
    consumption. A popular integrator is the Boris-Buneman method, also utilized
    in the Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library (OPAL) at the Paul
    Scherrer Institut. Until now, constant time steps are applied to carry the
    simulation forward in time. In this thesis we investigate whether adapting
    solely the global time step, used for moving all particles, can provide
    enhanced efficiency. We make an ex- cursion into the world of adaptive
    methods and propose an adaptive variant of the Boris-Buneman method. First
    tests with a prototype implementation in OPAL show promising results,
    despite the rather simple way how the time step is adapted.
