  abstract: >-
    A number of issues related to floating point accuracy and compliance are a
    frequent source of confusion on both CPUs and GPUs. The purpose of this
    white pa-per is to discuss the most common issues related to NVIDIA GPUs and
    to supplement the documentation in the CUDA C Programming Guide [7].
