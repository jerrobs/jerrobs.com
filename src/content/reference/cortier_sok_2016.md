  abstract: >-
    There have been intensive research efforts in the last two decades or so to
    design and deploy electronic voting (e-voting) protocols/systems which allow
    voters and/or external auditors to check that the votes were counted
    correctly. This security property, which not least was motivated by numerous
    problems in even national elections, is called veriﬁability. It is meant to
    defend against voting devices and servers that have programming errors or
    are outright malicious. In order to properly evaluate and analyze e-voting
    protocols w.r.t. veriﬁability, one fundamental challenge has been to
    formally capture the meaning of this security property. While the ﬁrst
    formal deﬁnitions of veriﬁability were devised in the late 1980s already,
    new veriﬁability deﬁnitions are still being proposed. The deﬁnitions differ
    in various aspects, including the classes of protocols they capture and even
    their formulations of the very core of the meaning of veriﬁability. This is
    an unsatisfying state of affairs, leaving the research on the veriﬁability
    of e-voting protocols in a fuzzy state.
