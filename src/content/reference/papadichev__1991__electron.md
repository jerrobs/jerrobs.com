    The expressions for electron paths in various types of undulators with and
    without axial magnetic field Bz are given, Bz is usually applied for
    transporting high-current beams of electrons with rather low energy. Also,
    expressions are derived for the transverse velocity acquired by electrons in
    stray fields of undulators, and after they have passed the adiabatic entry
    of undulators with various forms of field increase (Bz = 0 or Bz ≠ 0).
    Transverse electron velocities can also arise from space charge and current
    forces of the beam in stationary transport conditions and in transition
    regions where the cross section of a transport channel varies. The possible
    effects are also evaluated.
