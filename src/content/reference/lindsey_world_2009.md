    We analyzed the color terms in the World Color Survey (WCS)
    (www.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/), a large color-naming database obtained from
    informants of mostly unwritten languages spoken in preindustrialized
    cultures that have had limited contact with modern, industrialized society.
    The color naming idiolects of 2,367 WCS informants fall into three to six
    “motifs,” where each motif is a different color-naming system based on a
    subset of a universal glossary of 11 color terms. These motifs are universal
    in that they occur worldwide, with some individual variation, in completely
    unrelated languages. Strikingly, these few motifs are distributed across the
    WCS informants in such a way that multiple motifs occur in most languages.
    Thus, the culture a speaker comes from does not completely determine how he
    or she will use color terms. An analysis of the modern patterns of motif
    usage in the WCS languages, based on the assumption that they reflect
    historical patterns of color term evolution, suggests that color lexicons
    have changed over time in a complex but orderly way. The worldwide
    distribution of the motifs and the cooccurrence of multiple motifs within
    languages suggest that universal processes control the naming of colors.
