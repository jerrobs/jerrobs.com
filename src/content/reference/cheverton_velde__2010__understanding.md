    Understanding the Professional Buyer is a practical guide for sales people,
    giving them insight into the behaviour and strategies of buyers, so that
    they are able to deal with them more successfully and regain power in the
    buyer-seller relationship. In recent years the balance of power between
    buyer and seller has swung dramatically in favour of the buyer. Sellers are
    now faced with more professional, more knowledgeable and more powerful
    buyers - and the sales techniques used in previous years are no longer
    working. This book shows how to understand this new breed of buyer, in order
    to interact with them on a more level playing field. Contents include
    developments in the industry; purchasing organizations; types of buyers;
    purchasing analysis; and crucially, buyer-seller relations.
