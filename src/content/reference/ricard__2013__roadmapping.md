    The PhD thesis focuses on the coordination of technology-intensive
    innovation activities at both sector and firm levels, supported by the use
    of the strategic roadmapping method. Investigations combine qualitative and
    quantitative research methods; using a narrative approach in the form of
    interviews to uncover innovation and technology barriers, and a social
    network analysis of stakeholders’ role in relation to two technology
    platforms during a five-year period when the roadmaps 2020 were developed.
    In this respect, the thesis emphasizes the view of innovation as an
    interactive process to develop competences among technology users,
    producers, research institutions, and politicians. As a result, knowledge on
    how the platforms evolved, and their dynamics, provide new reflections on
    the innovation systems approach: that connectivity seems to change along the
    changes in problem. This is how the players create new knowledge. Thus, the
    identification of political and technical barriers is important selection
    mechanisms in how connectivity grows and changes. The thesis, furthermore,
    includes practical experience and account of roadmap development at the firm
    level providing reflections on dynamic capabilities. Understanding
    roadmapping has been a journey in this research showing that there is no
    ‘one size fits all’. Rather the strength of roadmapping lies in the
    participatory process and in the action-oriented, systematic framework that
    aligns layers of information while moving from a current position to a
    desired future.
