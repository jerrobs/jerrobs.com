    What determines how languages categorize colors? We analyzed results of the
    World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show that despite gross
    differences across languages, communication of chromatic chips is always
    better for warm colors (yellows/reds) than cool colors (blues/greens). We
    present an analysis of color statistics in a large databank of natural
    images curated by human observers for salient objects and show that objects
    tend to have warm rather than cool colors. These results suggest that the
    cross-linguistic similarity in color-naming efficiency reflects colors of
    universal usefulness and provide an account of a principle (color use) that
    governs how color categories come about. We show that potential
    methodological issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic
    analyses, by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the
    color-naming task, in three groups: the Tsimane', a remote Amazonian
    hunter-gatherer isolate; Bolivian-Spanish speakers; and English speakers.
    These data also enabled us to test another prediction of the
    color-usefulness hypothesis: that differences in color categorization
    between languages are caused by differences in overall usefulness of color
    to a culture. In support, we found that color naming among Tsimane' had
    relatively low communicative efficiency, and the Tsimane' were less likely
    to use color terms when describing familiar objects. Color-naming among
    Tsimane' was boosted when naming artificially colored objects compared with
    natural objects, suggesting that industrialization promotes color
    usefulness.
