    We compare relativistic particle integrators commonly used in plasma
    physics, showing several test cases relevant for astrophysics. Three
    explicit particle pushers are considered, namely, the Boris, Vay, and
    Higuera–Cary schemes. We also present a new relativistic fully implicit
    particle integrator that is energy conserving. Furthermore, a method based
    on the relativistic guiding center approximation is included. The algorithms
    are described such that they can be readily implemented in
    magnetohydrodynamics codes or Particle-in-Cell codes. Our comparison focuses
    on the strengths and key features of the particle integrators. We test the
    conservation of invariants of motion and the accuracy of particle drift
    dynamics in highly relativistic, mildly relativistic, and non-relativistic
    settings. The methods are compared in idealized test cases, i.e., without
    considering feedback onto the electrodynamic ﬁelds, collisions, pair
    creation, or radiation. The test cases include uniform electric and magnetic
    ﬁelds, E ´ B ﬁelds, force-free ﬁelds, and setups relevant for high-energy
    astrophysics, e.g., a magnetic mirror, a magnetic dipole, and a magnetic
    null. These tests have direct relevance for particle acceleration in shocks
    and in magnetic reconnection.
