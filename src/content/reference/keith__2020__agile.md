    In Agile Game Development , Clinton Keith offered game development team
    members the first complete blueprint for leveraging the power of Scrum and
    Agile methods to deliver games more efficiently, rapidly, and
    cost-effectively; create games that offer more entertainment value; and make
    life more fulfilling for every development team member. Now, reflecting his
    unsurpassed experience helping more than 150 game development studios
    succeed, Keith has thoroughly revamped his classic guide for today's
    radically transformed industry. The only Certified Scrum Trainer to help
    build 20 AAA-level games, Keith is singularly well-placed to help game
    developers solve the problems they actually face. In this edition, he:

    and new chapters on managing the first release, forming and leading Agile
    teams, game pipelines, and more Presents many new date stories about the
    experiences of actual game development teams, with actionable takeaways
    Illuminates advanced Agile projects through new "Things to Try" sidebars
    Covers Kanban and other Agile methodologies as well as Scrum Around the
    world, thousands of professional game developers have already used Agile
    Game Development to dramatically improve their effectiveness - and enjoy
    their work more. This 2nd Edition offers today's professionals even more
    value - no matter what types of games they're developing, what development
    roles they play, or what environments they're working in.
