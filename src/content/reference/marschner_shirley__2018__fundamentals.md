    Drawing on an impressive roster of experts in the field, Fundamentals of
    Computer Graphics, Fourth Edition offers an ideal resource for computer
    course curricula as well as a user-friendly personal or professional
    reference. Focusing on geometric intuition, the book gives the necessary
    information for understanding how images get onto the screen by using the
    complementary approaches of ray tracing and rasterization. It covers topics
    common to an introductory course, such as sampling theory, texture mapping,
    spatial data structure, and splines. It also includes a number of
    contributed chapters from authors known for their expertise and clear way of
    explaining concepts. Highlights of the Fourth Edition Include: Updated
    coverage of existing topics Major updates and improvements to several
    chapters, including texture mapping, graphics hardware, signal processing,
    and data structures A text now printed entirely in four-color to enhance
    illustrative figures of concepts The fourth edition of Fundamentals of
    Computer Graphics continues to provide an outstanding and comprehensive
    introduction to basic computer graphic technology and theory. It retains an
    informal and intuitive style while improving precision, consistency, and
    completeness of material, allowing aspiring and experienced graphics
    programmers to better understand and apply foundational principles to the
    development of efficient code in creating film, game, or web designs. Key
    Features Provides a thorough treatment of basic and advanced topics in
    current graphics algorithms Explains core principles intuitively, with
    numerous examples and pseudo-code Gives updated coverage of the graphics
    pipeline, signal processing, texture mapping, graphics hardware, reflection
    models, and curves and surfaces Uses color images to give more illustrative
    power to concepts.
