    Policymaking requires an in-depth understanding of the cause-and-effect
    relationships between the sustainable development goals. However, due to the
    complex nature of socio-economic and environmental systems, this is still a
    challenging task. In the present article, the interconnectedness of the
    United Nations (UN) sustainability goals is measured using the Granger
    causality analysis of their indicators. The applicability of the causality
    analysis is validated through the predictions of the World3 model. The
    causal relationships are represented as a network of sustainability
    indicators providing the opportunity for the application of network analysis
    techniques. Based on the analysis of 801 UN indicator types in 283
    geographical regions, approximately 4000 causal relationships were identiﬁed
    and the most important global connections were represented in a causal loop
    network. The results highlight the drastic deﬁciency of the analysed
    datasets, the strong interconnectedness of the sustainability targets and
    the applicability of the extracted causal loop network. The analysis of the
    causal loop networks emphasised the problems of poverty, proper sanitation
    and economic support in sustainable development.
