  abstract: >-
    Important elements of games, movies, and other computer-generated content,
    shadows are crucial for enhancing realism and providing important visual
    cues. In recent years, there have been notable improvements in visual
    quality and speed, making high-quality realistic real-time shadows a
    reachable goal. Real-Time Shadows is a comprehensive guide to the theory and
    practice of real-time shadow techniques. It covers a large variety of
    different effects, including hard, soft, volumetric, and semi-transparent
    shadows. The book explains the basics as well as many advanced aspects
    related to the domain of shadow computation. It presents interactive
    solutions and practical details on shadow computation. The authors compare
    various algorithms for creating real-time shadows and illustrate how they
    are used in different situations. They explore the limitations and failure
    cases, advantages and disadvantages, and suitability of the algorithms in
    several applications. Source code, videos, tutorials, and more are available
    on the bookâ€™s website www.realtimeshadows.com.
