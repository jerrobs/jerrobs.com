  abstract: >-
    We examine the popular Personas method and consider claims that personas can
    reflect empirical data and serve as an information source for development
    teams. We argue that there are significant methodological and practical
    difficulties for personas. It is difficult to determine how many, if any,
    users are represented by a persona, and thus is difficult to know whether a
    persona is relevant for intended users. Personas cannot be adequately
    verified or falsified and therefore have no demonstrable validity. We
    believe personas are likely to lead to political conflicts and to undermine
    the ability for researchers to resolve questions with data. We suggest
    potential research to evaluate the Personas method more thoroughly. Until
    the methodological issues are resolved, it is best not to consider personas
    to be a means to communicate data.
