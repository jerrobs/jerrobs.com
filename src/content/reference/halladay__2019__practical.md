    It's time to stop thinking that shaders are magical. You can use shaders to
    turn data into stunning visual effects, and get your hands dirty by building
    your own shader with this step-by-step introduction to shader development
    for game and graphics developers. Learn how to make shaders that move, tint,
    light up, and look awesome, all without cracking open a math textbook.
    Practical Shader Development teaches the theory behind how shaders work. The
    book also shows you how to apply that theory to create eye-popping visual
    effects. You'll learn to profile and optimize those effects to make sure
    your projects keep running quickly with all their new visuals. You'll learn
    good theory, good practices, and without getting bogged down in the math.
    Author Kyle Halladay explains the fundamentals of shader development through
    simple examples and hands-on experiments. He teaches you how to find
    performance issues in shaders you are using and then how to fix them. Kyle
    explains (and contrasts) how to use the knowledge learned from this book in
    three of the most popular game engines today. What You'll Learn Understand
    what shaders are and how they work Get up to speed on the nuts and bolts of
    writing vertex and fragment shaders Utilize color blending and know how
    blend equations work Know the coordinate spaces used when rendering
    real-time computer graphics Use simple math to animate characters, simulate
    lights, and create a wide variety of visual effects Find and fix performance
    problems in shaders See how three popular game engines (Unity, UE4, Godot)
    handle shaders Who This Book Is For Programmers who are interested in
    writing their own shaders but do not know where to start, anyone who has
    ever seen shader code on a forum and wished they knew how to modify it just
    a little bit to fit into their own projects, and game developers who are
    tired of using the default shaders found in the game engines they are using.
    The book is especially useful for those who have been put off by existing
    shader tutorials which introduce complex math and graphics theory before
    ever getting something on the screen.
