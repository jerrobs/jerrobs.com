    Projects have become the de facto method of implementing business strategy
    and operations. As such, understanding how projects relate to business
    strategy and managing projects strategically is increasingly important to
    effective and efficient business management This book is designed as a short
    and concise treatise on how to go about doing that. The authors start by
    figuring out how the project relates to the rest of the business and
    environment and what separates it from other projects and functions. They go
    on to discuss how you can use principles of strategic management to better
    organize and manage the various projects you may be dealing with on a daily
    basis so that they are strategic in nature. In essence, this book details
    how to approach answering the important strategic questions in project
    management like—“Why is the project being implemented? How does the project
    relate to the major strategic goals of the organization? How do we
    accomplish the performance goals for the project so that they help achieve
    the major strategic goals of the organization?”
