  abstract: "The open-source Bmad software library has been developed for simulating both charged particle beams and X-rays. Owing to its modular, object-oriented design, Bmad has proved to be versatile, and is currently used in a number of programs at Cornell's Laboratory for Elementary-Particle Physics. This paper will discuss the design of the Bmad library and how features such as the ability to simulate overlapping elements, the ability to define the action of control-room “knobs,” and the ability to select among different tracking algorithms, have all\_…"
