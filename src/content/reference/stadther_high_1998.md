    In the first part of this presentation we will take a brief look at the
    tremendous growth in computational power that is ongoing, from desktop
    machines to high performance computing hardware. It will come as no surprise
    to this audience that computational power has grown very quickly and
    continues to grow very quickly. The availability of all this power allows us
    to solve problems much faster. This means we can solve larger problems
    involving more complex and more realistic models. It allows us to solve
    problems we probably would not have even considered
    tryingtosolveyearsago,becauseoftheircomputationaldemands.
    Allofthishasmadepossible significant advances in many fields of science and
    engineering. But, another thing we can use all this computer power for, that
    is often overlooked in the quest to solve problems faster and faster, is
    that we can use it to solve problems more reliably—in fact to actually
    provide mathematical and computational guarantees of reliability. So in the
    second part of this presentation we will focus on issues of reliability—what
    good is high performance computing if we are just computing the wrong answer
    faster?
