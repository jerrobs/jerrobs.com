    This new edition gives project managers practical methods and tools to make
    the right decisions while juggling multiple objectives, risks and
    uncertainties, and stakeholders. Project management requires you to navigate
    a maze of multiple and complex decisions that are an everyday part of the
    job. To be effective, you must know how to make rational choices with your
    projects, what processes can help to improve these choices, and what tools
    are available to help you with decision-making. An entertaining and
    easy-to-read guide to a structured project decision-making process, Project
    Decisions will help you identify risks and perform basic quantitative and
    qualitative risk and decision analyses. Lev Virine and Michael Trumper use
    their understanding of basic human psychology to show you how to use event
    chain methodology, establish creative business environments, and estimate
    project time and costs. Each phase of the process is described in detail,
    including a review of both its psychological aspects and quantitative
    methods.
