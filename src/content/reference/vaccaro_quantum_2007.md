  abstract: >-
    We describe quantum protocols for voting and surveying. A key feature of our
    schemes is the use of entangled states to ensure that the votes are
    anonymous and to allow the votes to be tallied. The entanglement is
    distributed over separated sites; the physical inaccessibility of any one
    site is sufficient to guarantee the anonymity of the votes. The security of
    these protocols with respect to various kinds of attack is discussed. We
    also discuss classical schemes and show that our quantum voting protocol
    represents a N-fold reduction in computational complexity, where N is the
    number of voters.
