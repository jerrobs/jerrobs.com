    Internet voting continues to enjoy wide interest from both research and
    practice. Among the Internet voting schemes developed over the last decades,
    JCJ / Civitas stands out from the masses due to its innovative approach to
    resist voter coercion. To achieve its ambitious goal, the scheme builds upon
    particularly restrictive assumptions and an abstract credential handling
    rendering the scheme impractical for real-world use. At ARES 2012, Neumann
    and Volkamer presented a proposal which implements several of these
    assumptions (voter-side assumptions) and the credential handling by the use
    of smart cards. While addressing these practical shortcomings of JCJ /
    Civitas, their proposal did not take performance into account, and
    accordingly its performance has not been evaluated. In the present work, we
    revise the ARES proposal from a performance perspective in a
    security-invariant manner. Based on the herein proposed revisions, we are
    able to conclude that the revised ARES proposal is feasible to be used in
    real-world elections.
