    The empirical evidence that human color categorization exhibits some
    universal patterns beyond superficial discrepancies across different
    cultures is a major breakthrough in cognitive science. As observed in the
    World Color Survey (WCS), indeed, any two groups of individuals develop
    quite different categorization patterns, but some universal properties can
    be identified by a statistical analysis over a large number of populations.
    Here, we reproduce the WCS in a numerical model in which different
    populations develop independently their own categorization systems by
    playing elementary language games. We find that a simple perceptual
    constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just Noticeable Difference
    (JND), is sufficient to trigger the emergence of universal patterns that
    unconstrained cultural interaction fails to produce. We test the results of
    our experiment against real data by performing the same statistical analysis
    proposed to quantify the universal tendencies shown in the WCS [Kay P &
    Regier T. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100: 9085-9089], and obtain an
    excellent quantitative agreement. This work confirms that synthetic modeling
    has nowadays reached the maturity to contribute significantly to the ongoing
    debate in cognitive science.
