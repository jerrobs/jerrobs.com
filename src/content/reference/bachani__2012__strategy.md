    Nonprofit Organizations need strategies to be effective, but the available
    tools for making strategy were developed primarily for business
    organizations. This book provides a model and several case studies for
    Strategy Making in Nonprofit Organizations. The strategy making model
    modifies the business practices of Strategy-Structure-Systems for the
    nonprofit context with a focus on Purpose-Processes-People that is more
    suitable to meet their unique challenges. In this book, the leaders of
    nonprofit organizations will find ways to better articulate the challenges
    that their organizations face for communicating with their business
    partners, donors and employees. As the demand for essential social services
    is growing and the budgets are declining, leaders and managers in both
    Nonprofit and Business organizations need the solutions offered in this
    book. Nonprofit Organizations face an external environment where demand
    outstrips their ability to meet it. They face competition in raising funds
    and resources to provide these services. They rely on processes to harness
    the creativity of their people in delivering to the triple bottom line of
    economic, social and environmental impact. This book provides a bridge
    between business and nonprofit organizations.
