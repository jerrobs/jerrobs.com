    We study the basic naming game model and the recently introduced Bayesian
    naming game model, in which the name learning processes are described more
    realistically within a Bayesian learning framework. We focus on the dynamics
    of the bilinguals population and show that in the Bayesian model the number
    of bilinguals is always lower with respect to the basic naming game model.
    We provide some analytical estimates of the upper bound for the number of
    bilinguals in both models and validate the estimate through extensive
    numerical simulations.
