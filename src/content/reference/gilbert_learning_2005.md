    This chapter describes learning electromagnetism with visualizations and
    focuses on the value of concrete and visual representations in teaching
    abstract concepts. We start with a theoretical background consisting of
    three subsections: visualization in science, simulations and
    microcomputer-based laboratory, and studies that investigated the
    effectiveness of simulations and real-time graphing in physics. We then
    present the TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) project for MIT's
    introductory electromagnetism course as a case in point. We demonstrate the
    various types of visualizations and how they are used in the TEAL classroom.
    A description of a large-scale study at MIT follows. In this study, we
    investigated the effects of introducing 2D and 3D visualizations into an
    active learning setting on learning outcomes in both the cognitive and
    affective domains. We conclude by describing an example of TEAL classroom
    discourse, which demonstrates the effects and benefits of the TEAL project
    in general, and the active learning and visualizations in particular.
