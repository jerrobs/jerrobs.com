  abstract: >-
    A charged particle accelerator is a complex machine that takes elementary
    charged particles and accelerates them to very high energies.  Accelerator
    physics is a field of physics encompassing all the aspects required to
    design and operate the equipment and to understand the resulting dynamics of
    the charged particles.  There are software packages associated with each
    such domain. There are a large number of such codes. The 1990 edition of the
    Los Alamos Accelerator Code Group's compendium  provides summaries of more
    than 200 codes. Certain of those codes are still in use today although many
    are obsolete. Another index of existing and historical accelerator
    simulation codes is located at
