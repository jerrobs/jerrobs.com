    In this paper, we report on a fast second-order numerical integrator to
    solve the Lorentz force equations of a relativistic charged particle in
    electromagnetic fields. This numerical integrator shows less numerical error
    than the popular Boris algorithm in tracking the relativistic particle
    subject to electric and magnetic space-charge fields and requires less
    number of operations than another recently proposed relativistic integrator.
