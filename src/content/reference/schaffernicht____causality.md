  abstract: >-
    Polarity and causality are important concepts but have not received much
    attention in the system dynamics literature. The great effort it takes
    students to properly understand them has motivated this inquiry. In the
    framework of a conceptual model of interacting with complex systems, several
    cognitive tasks are proposed. This paper concentrates on one of them that
    deals with causal links’ polarity. An examination of other approaches that
    deal with causality and use more or less similar diagram languages shows
    that usually causality is only very broadly defined, and where it is
    operationally defined, this is done with respect to events rather than
    behavior. In contrast to these approaches, system dynamics is about behavior
    rather than events. We then revisit the traditional criticism of causal loop
    diagrams and show a way out, but add two new criticisms related to the
    inability of causal loop diagrams to address behavior: in fact it seems that
    they are closer to the event-related definition of causality. Also, the
    impossibility to execute them in simulations means that executable
    concept-models are to be preferred: they express important information a
    causal loop diagram cannot represent and on top of it they render the
    behavioral consequences visible (as opposed to the events). In conclusion,
    causal loop diagrams should only be used by experienced modelers, and be
    banned from educational use.
