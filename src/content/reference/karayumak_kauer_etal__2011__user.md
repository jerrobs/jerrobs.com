    There is increasing interest in cryptographic veriﬁability in remote
    electronic voting schemes. Helios is one example of an open-source
    implementation. In previous work, we proposed an improved version of the
    original Helios interface in version 3.1 for vote casting and individual
    veriﬁability. We now test this interface in a mock mayoral election set up
    with 34 users. Users are given instructions and ﬁll out questionnaires
    before and after the vote casting process. Data on mouse movements and time
    is collected and a modiﬁed helmet with eye tracking lenses is used to
    capture eye movement data. The study shows that the interface is easy to use
    while people have difﬁculty understanding the motivation for and the concept
    of veriﬁability.
