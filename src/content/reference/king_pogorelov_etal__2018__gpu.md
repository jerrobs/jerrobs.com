  abstract: >-
    Elegant is an accelerator physics and particle-beam dynamics code widely
    used for modeling and design of a variety of high-energy particle
    accelerators and accelerator-based systems. We discuss a recently developed
    version of the code that can take advantage of CUDA-enabled graphics
    processing units (GPUs) to achieve significantly improved performance for a
    large class of simulations that are important in practice. The GPU version
    is largely defined by a framework that simplifies implementations of the
    fundamental kernel types that are used by Elegant: particle operations,
    reductions, particle loss, histograms, array convolutions and random number
    generation. Accelerated performance on the Titan Cray XK-7 supercomputer is
    approximately 6–10 times better with the GPU than all the CPU cores
    associated with the same node count. In addition to performance, the
    maintainability of the GPU-accelerated version of the code was considered a
    key design objective. Accuracy with respect to the CPU implementation is
    also a core consideration. Finally, four different methods are used to
    ensure that the accelerated code faithfully reproduces the CPU results.
