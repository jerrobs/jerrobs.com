  abstract: >-
    The ability of existing strategy concepts to analyse strategy, design
    strategy and execute strategy within organisations has an alarmingly poor
    historical track record. Based on the long-standing semiotics and ontology
    research work of the Global University Alliance (GUA) and its members, a
    Strategy Lifecycle is introduced. The StrategyLifecycle, underpinned by
    ontology and semiotics incorporates all the constructs that can be found in
    the most popular strategy concepts and frameworks. It explains the value of
    the underlying strategy ontology and the relationship between the strategy
    meta model, the Strategy Lifecycle and various artefacts used around
    strategy work. The paper concludes with futurescope and application that
    lies ahead for the Strategy Lifecycle.
