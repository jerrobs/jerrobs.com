    Strategy (from Greek στρατηγία stratēgia, "art of troop leader; office of
    general, command, generalship") is a general plan to achieve one or more
    long-term or overall goals under conditions of uncertainty. In the sense of
    the "art of the general", which included several subsets of skills including
    military tactics, siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the
    6th century C.E. in Eastern Roman terminology, and was translated into
    Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. From then until the
    20th century, the word "strategy" came to denote "a comprehensive way to try
    to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a
    dialectic of wills" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries
    interact.Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve
    goals are usually limited. Strategy generally involves setting goals and
    priorities, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing
    resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals)
    will be achieved by the means (resources). Strategy can be intended or can
    emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its
    environment or competes. It involves activities such as strategic planning
    and strategic thinking.Henry Mintzberg from McGill University defined
    strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions to contrast with a view of
    strategy as planning, while Henrik von Scheel defines the essence of
    strategy as the activities to deliver a unique mix of value – choosing to
    perform activities differently or to perform different activities than
    rivals. while Max McKeown (2011) argues that "strategy is about shaping the
    future" and is the human attempt to get to "desirable ends with available
    means". Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as "a system of finding,
    formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if
    followed faithfully." Complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding
    of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in
    actions in a socio-economic context.
