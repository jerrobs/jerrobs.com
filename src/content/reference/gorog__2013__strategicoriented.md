  abstract: >-
    Can a project be both a success and a failure? You may be hitting your
    deadlines and keeping within your budget... but if your project isn't
    meeting your organization's larger strategic goals, it may actually be
    failing. While it is broadly accepted that projects are the building blocks
    in implementing organizational strategic objectives, many books fail to
    address one critical question: how do you translate a strategic objective
    into a manageable project task? Lavishly illustrated with more than 40
    figures and tables, this latest book from practitioner and project
    management professor Mih ly G r g, PhD addresses this critical lack, for
    project managers of all levels. With each of its chapters devoted to
    exploring a specific topic, the book begins by focusing on internal projects
    within an organization. Using real-world examples from multiple industries,
    Dr. G r g effortlessly provides both theory and practical tools for thinking
    and working strategically throughout the project process, including
    mastering scope challenges and evaluating project success. The second half
    of the book then explores how to meet the unique strategic challenges
    presented by projects involving external contractors and includes how to
    differentiate between contract and payment; allocate responsibilities and
    risks; create contractor competition; and identify the best bid (and
    bidder). Strategic Oriented Implementation of Projects is that rare book
    that is both strategic oriented and practical and provides project and
    program managers with the tools to ensure that their internal and external
    projects actually meet their organization's strategic goals.
