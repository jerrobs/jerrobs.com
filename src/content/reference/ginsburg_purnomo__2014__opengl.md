    OpenGL® ES is the industry's leading software interface and graphics library
    for rendering sophisticated 3D graphics on handheld and embedded devices.
    The newest version, OpenGL ES 3.0, makes it possible to create stunning
    visuals for new games and apps, without compromising device performance or
    battery life. In the OpenGL ® ES 3.0 Programming Guide, Second Edition, the
    authors cover the entire API and Shading Language. They carefully introduce
    OpenGL ES 3.0 features such as shadow mapping, instancing, multiple render
    targets, uniform buffer objects, texture compression, program binaries, and
    transform feedback. Through detailed, downloadable C-based code examples,
    you'll learn how to set up and program every aspect of the graphics
    pipeline. Step by step, you'll move from introductory techniques all the way
    to advanced per-pixel lighting and particle systems. Throughout, you'll find
    cutting-edge tips for optimizing performance, maximizing efficiency with
    both the API and hardware, and fully leveraging OpenGL ES 3.0 in a wide
    spectrum of applications. All code has been built and tested on iOS 7,
    Android 4.3, Windows (OpenGL ES 3.0 Emulation), and Ubuntu Linux, and the
    authors demonstrate how to build OpenGL ES code for each platform. Coverage
    in c ludes EGL API: communicating with the native windowing system, choosing
    configurations, and creating rendering contexts and surfaces Shaders:
    creating and attaching shader objects; compiling shaders; checking for
    compile errors; creating, linking, and querying program objects; and using
    source shaders and program binaries OpenGL ES Shading Language: variables,
    types, constructors, structures, arrays, attributes, uniform blocks, I/O
    variables, precision qualifiers, and invariance Geometry, vertices, and
    primitives: inputting geometry into the pipeline, and assembling it into
    primitives 2D/3D, Cubemap, Array texturing: creation, loading, and
    rendering; texture wrap modes, filtering, and formats; compressed textures,
    sampler objects, immutable textures, pixel unpack buffer objects, and
    mipmapping Fragment shaders: multitexturing, fog, alpha test, and user clip
    planes Fragment operations: scissor, stencil, and depth tests;
    multisampling, blending, and dithering Framebuffer objects: rendering to
    offscreen surfaces for advanced effects Advanced rendering: per-pixel
    lighting, environment mapping, particle systems, image post-processing,
    procedural textures, shadow mapping, terrain, and projective textures.
