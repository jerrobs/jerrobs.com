  abstract: >-
    In Estonian Parliamentary elections held in 2011, the percentage of Internet
    voters among all the voters was as high as 24.3%. At the same time a student
    implemented a proof-of-concept malware which demonstrated the effective
    disenfranchisement of the voter from the right to vote. The chapter gives an
    overview of risk assessment and threat modeling of Estonian Internet voting
    after the events of 2011. The chapter presents a classification of attacks
    against the voting method, distinguishing between manipulation attacks,
    revocation attacks and attacks towards public confidence.
