    GPU Computing Gems, Jade Edition, offers hands-on, proven techniques for
    general purpose GPU programming based on the successful application
    experiences of leading researchers and developers. One of few resources
    available that distills the best practices of the community of CUDA
    programmers, this second edition contains 100% new material of interest
    across industry, including finance, medicine, imaging, engineering, gaming,
    environmental science, and green computing. It covers new tools and
    frameworks for productive GPU computing application development and provides
    immediate benefit to researchers developing improved programming
    environments for GPUs. Divided into five sections, this book explains how
    GPU execution is achieved with algorithm implementation techniques and
    approaches to data structure layout. More specifically, it considers three
    general requirements: high level of parallelism, coherent memory access by
    threads within warps, and coherent control flow within warps. Chapters
    explore topics such as accelerating database searches; how to leverage the
    Fermi GPU architecture to further accelerate prefix operations; and GPU
    implementation of hash tables. There are also discussions on the state of
    GPU computing in interactive physics and artificial intelligence;
    programming tools and techniques for GPU computing; and the edge and node
    parallelism approach for computing graph centrality metrics. In addition,
    the book proposes an alternative approach that balances computation
    regardless of node degree variance. Software engineers, programmers,
    hardware engineers, and advanced students will find this book extremely
    useful. This second volume of GPU Computing Gems offers 100% new material of
    interest across industry, including finance, medicine, imaging, engineering,
    gaming, environmental science, green computing, and more Covers new tools
    and frameworks for productive GPU computing application development and
    offers immediate benefit to researchers developing improved programming
    environments for GPUs Even more hands-on, proven techniques demonstrating
    how general purpose GPU computing is changing scientific research Distills
    the best practices of the community of CUDA programmers; each chapter
    provides insights and ideas as well as 'hands on' skills applicable to a
    variety of fields
