    The idea of using the stencil buffer to generate shadows has been around for
    over a decade, but only recently has 3D graphics hardware advanced to the
    point where using the stencil algorithm on a large scale has become
    practical. Not long ago, there existed some unsolved problems pertaining to
    stencil shadows that prevented the algorithm from working correctly under
    various conditions. Advances have now been made, however, so that stencil
    shadows can be robustly implemented to handle arbitrarily positioned point
    lights and infinite directional lights having any desired spatial
    relationship with the camera. This article presents the intricacies of the
    entire stencil shadow algorithm and covers every mathematical detail of its
    efficient implementation.
