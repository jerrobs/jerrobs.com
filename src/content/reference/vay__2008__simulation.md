    This paper addresses the numerical issues related to the modeling of beams
    or plasmas crossing at relativistic velocity using the Particle-In-Cell
    method. Issues related to the use of the standard Boris particle pusher are
    identiﬁed and a novel pusher which circumvents them is proposed, whose
    eﬀectiveness is demonstrated on single particle tests. A procedure for
    solving the ﬁelds is proposed, which retains electrostatic, magnetostatic
    and inductive ﬁeld eﬀects in the direction of the mean velocity of the
    species, is fully explicit and simpler than the full Darwin approximation.
    Finally, results are given, from a calculation using the novel features, of
    an ultra-relativistic beam interacting with a background of electrons.
