  abstract: >-
    This standard specifies interchange and arithmetic formats and methods for
    binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic in computer programming
    environments. This standard specifies exception conditions and their default
    handling. An implementation of a floating-point system conforming to this
    standard may be realized entirely in software, entirely in hardware, or in
    any combination of software and hardware. For operations specified in the
    normative part of this standard, numerical results and exceptions are
    uniquely determined by the values of the input data, sequence of operations,
    and destination formats, all under user control.
