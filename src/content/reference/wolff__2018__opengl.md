    Over 70 recipes that cover advanced techniques for 3D programming such as
    lighting, shading, textures, particle systems, and image processing with
    OpenGL 4.6 Key Features Explore techniques for implementing shadows using
    shadow maps and shadow volumes Learn to use GLSL features such as compute,
    geometry, and tessellation shaders Use GLSL to create a wide variety of
    modern, realistic visual effects Book Description OpenGL 4 Shading Language
    Cookbook, Third Edition provides easy-to-follow recipes that first walk you
    through the theory and background behind each technique, and then proceed to
    showcase and explain the GLSL and OpenGL code needed to implement them. The
    book begins by familiarizing you with beginner-level topics such as
    compiling and linking shader programs, saving and loading shader binaries
    (including SPIR-V), and using an OpenGL function loader library. We then
    proceed to cover basic lighting and shading effects. After that, you'll
    learn to use textures, produce shadows, and use geometry and tessellation
    shaders. Topics such as particle systems, screen-space ambient occlusion,
    deferred rendering, depth-based tessellation, and physically based rendering
    will help you tackle advanced topics. OpenGL 4 Shading Language Cookbook,
    Third Edition also covers advanced topics such as shadow techniques
    (including the two of the most common techniques: shadow maps and shadow
    volumes). You will learn how to use noise in shaders and how to use compute
    shaders. The book provides examples of modern shading techniques that can be
    used as a starting point for programmers to expand upon to produce modern,
    interactive, 3D computer-graphics applications. What you will learn Compile,
    debug, and communicate with shader programs Use compute shaders for physics,
    animation, and general computing Learn about features such as shader storage
    buffer objects and image load/store Utilize noise in shaders and learn how
    to use shaders in animations Use textures for various effects including cube
    maps for reflection or refraction Understand physically based reflection
    models and the SPIR-V Shader binary Learn how to create shadows using shadow
    maps or shadow volumes Create particle systems that simulate smoke, fire,
    and other effects Who this book is for If you are a graphics programmer
    looking to learn the GLSL shading language, this book is for you. A basic
    understanding of 3D graphics and programming experience with C++ are
    required.
