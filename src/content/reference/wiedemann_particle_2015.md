    Particle Accelerator Physics is an in-depth and comprehensive introduction
    to the field of high-energy particle acceleration and beam dynamics. Part I
    gathers the basic tools, recalling the essentials of electrostatics and
    electrodynamics as well as of particle dynamics in electromagnetic fields.
    Part II is an extensive primer in beam dynamics, followed in Part III by the
    introduction and description of the main beam parameters. Part IV is devoted
    to the treatment of perturbations in beam dynamics. Part V discusses the
    details of charged particle acceleration. Part VI and Part VII introduce the
    more advanced topics of coupled beam dynamics and the description of very
    intense beams. Part VIII is an exhaustive treatment of radiation from
    accelerated charges and introduces important sources of coherent radiation
    such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers. Part IX collects the
    appendices gathering useful mathematical and physical formulae, parameters
    and units. Solutions to many end-of-chapter problems are given. This
    textbook is suitable for an intensive two-semester course starting at the
    advanced undergraduate level.
