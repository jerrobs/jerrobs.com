    Strategic planning becomes visual with strategy maps and the tools,
    techniques, and guidance for turning them into effective action. Developed
    as a companion workbook to John Bryson's best-selling Strategic Planning in
    Public and Nonprofit Organizations, Visual Strategy: A Workbook for Strategy
    Mapping in Public and Nonprofit Organizations, goes beyond making the case
    for good and effective strategic planning to making strategy visual through
    effective strategy mapping. Strategy mapping prevents groups of people from
    talking over one another and going around in circles. It helps people speak
    and be heard, produce lots of ideas and understand how they fit together,
    make use of causal reasoning, and clarify ultimately what they want to do in
    terms of mission, goals, strategies, and actions. Strategy mapping can join
    process and content in such a way that good ideas worth implementing are
    found and the agreements and comments needed to implement them are reached.
    The result is living strategic plans that act as useful guides to action.
    With detailed examples, actual strategy maps, process guidelines and
    hand-drawn illustrations, the book will help leaders, managers, students and
    other professionals see patterns across mission, goals, strategies and
    actions while helping to identify areas of alignment and misalignment and
    determine, real time, where elements are needed, missing or not useful in a
    strategic plan. For leaders and managers of public and nonprofit
    organizations, facilitators and consultants, professors and students of
    strategic planning, strategic management, strategic mapping, and public
    policy, professional development workshops focused on strategic planning and
    strategy mapping.
