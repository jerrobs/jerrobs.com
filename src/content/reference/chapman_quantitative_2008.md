    The personas method is said to present information about people of interest
    for product design. We propose a formal model to understand persona
    information in terms of factual attributes. Using an analytic model, we show
    that the expected prevalence rate of persona descriptions decreases rapidly
    as attributes are added. We then evaluate this expectation empirically.
    Using six survey datasets ranging from N=268 to N=10307 respondents and two
    simulated datasets, we determine the prevalence rates of 10000 randomly
    generated persona-like descriptions per dataset. Consistent with prediction,
    we observe decreasing prevalence rates as attributes are added. Pearson’s r
    for observed vs. predicted prevalence, transformed to multinormality, ranges
    r(9998)=0.394 to r(9998)=0.869 in the sampled datasets (all p < 0.001).
    Because descriptions with many attributes are likely to represent few
    people, we suggest that personas should be assessed empirically before they
    are assumed to describe real groups of people.
