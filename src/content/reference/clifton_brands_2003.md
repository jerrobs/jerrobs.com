  abstract: >-
    Brands today are key engines of economic strength. Far from being a
    superficial or cosmetic communications exercise, brands have become a
    central organising principle behind many ambitious companies. This
    authoritative book contains contributions from some of the field's leading
    practitioners, academics and consultants, analysing the nature and benefits
    of brands - particularly in terms of their sustainable business value and
    their wider social advantages. This is the definitive business book on
    brands and branding. It not only explains the economic strength and
    importance of brands, but als.
