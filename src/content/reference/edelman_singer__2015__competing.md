    The explosion of digital technologies over the past decade has created
    “empowered” consumers so expert in their use of tools and information that
    they can call the shots, hunting down what they want when they want it and
    getting it delivered to their doorsteps at a rock-bottom price. In response,
    retailers and service providers have scrambled to develop big data and
    analytics capabilities in order to understand their customers and wrest back
    control. For much of this time, companies have been reacting to customers,
    trying to anticipate their next moves and position themselves in shoppers’
    paths as they navigate the decision journey from consideration to purchase.
