  abstract: >-
    Strategic Project Management uses real life case examples to characterize
    and describe the organizational factors and conditions necessary for
    projects to thrive and to deliver the organization's strategic objectives.
    This characterization is formed around ten imperatives which senior managers
    can implement - both within individual projects and, even more crucially,
    within the institutions that sponsor them - using the tools provided.
    Accessible, practical and free of jargon, Strategic Project Management
    offers the solutions needed to successfully prioritize and manage a
    portfolio of projects, communicate aims, align priorities to organizational
    objectives, evaluate progress, manage supplier relationships and anticipate
    and mitigate the risks at every stage. Supported by a comprehensive package
    of online resources for project portfolio planning, management and analysis
    this book will help readers to build on their skills, knowledge and
    confidence to rise to the challenge of governing and delivering successful
    projects.
