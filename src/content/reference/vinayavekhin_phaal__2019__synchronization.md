    The research question is “How can firms approach synchronization in
    strategic planning?”, aiming to investigate opportunities for improved
    synchronization within strategic planning. The focus is on roadmapping, as a
    relatively simple, flexible and widely used method that includes time as an
    explicit dimension. The adopted methodology is a process approach,
    consisting of literature review, exploratory interviews, practitioner
    interviews, and case studies with large multinational firms based in the UK
    that are familiar with roadmapping. As a result, four types of
    synchronization have been identified and discussed, including generic forms
    of each type, illustrated with industrial examples from the case studies.
