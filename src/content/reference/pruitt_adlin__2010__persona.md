    If you design and develop products for people, this book is for you. The
    Persona Lifecycle addresses the “how of creating effective personas and
    using those personas to design products that people love. It doesn’t just
    describe the value of personas; it offers detailed techniques and tools
    related to planning, creating, communicating, and using personas to create
    great product designs. Moreover, it provides rich examples, samples, and
    illustrations to imitate and model. Perhaps most importantly, it positions
    personas not as a panacea, but as a method used to complement other
    user-centered design (UCD) techniques including scenario-based design,
    cognitive walkthroughs and user testing. John Pruitt is the User Research
    Manager for the Tablet & Mobile PC Division at Microsoft Corporation. Tamara
    Adlin is a Customer Experience Manager at Amazon.com. For the past six
    years, John and Tamara have been researching and using personas, leading
    workshops, and teaching courses at professional conferences and
    universities. They developed the Persona Lifecycle model to communicate the
    value and practical application of personas to product design and
    development professionals. Features * Presentation and discussion of the
    complete lifecycle of personas, to guide the designer at each stage of
    product development. * A running case study with rich examples and samples
    that demonstrate how personas can be used in building a product end-to-end.
    * Recommended best practices in techniques, tools, and innovative methods. *
    Hundreds of relevant stories, commentary, opinions, and case studies from
    user experience professionals across a variety of domains and industries.
