    This book is at the crossroads of web development and deep learning. Both
    technologies are beginning to meet, and this honeymoon will produce new
    fantastic applications that you cannot even imagine yet.


    In this book you will see how to concretely use the main JavaScript deep
    learning frameworks and web programming in the browser with the capture of
    inputs and the WebGL implementation. Deep learning in the browser is
    currently at an embryonic stage, but this is the best time to bet on it
    before it becomes a giant, and this book will get you in on the action.


    Are you ready to embark on the adventure?
