    There are many articles on how to construct a persona that represents your
    target audience. However, little attention is ever paid to the actual naming
    of these fictitious people. It is simply human nature to want to name
    things. If instead of calling our high school student persona "Martha" we
    just called her "Student Persona 11A" it wouldn't have the same impact. Just
    like real people, names matter and can influence the success or failure of
    your personas.
