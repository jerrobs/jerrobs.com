    The strategic emphasis in this book is as much on keeping customers as on
    getting them in the first place. The aim is to provide unique value in
    chosen markets, sustainable over time, which bring the customers back for
    more. Relationship marketing emphasizes both quality and customer service
    and how these can be managed towards closing the "quality gap" between what
    customers expect and what they get.
