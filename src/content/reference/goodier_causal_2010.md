    Thinking and planning for the future is critical in a competitive business
    world. Scenarios are a common technique for investigating the future, but
    can be time-consuming and challenging to develop, particularly when more
    than a single organisation is involved. An approach is presented here which
    shifts the focus of scenario building from the company level to the sector
    level, whereby a range of organisations engage collectively on a topic of
    mutual importance. A rapid technique was developed, with simple scenarios
    being constructed in 2 to 4 hours. This process was implemented in 13
    multi-organisational workshops with participants from the construction and
    building industries, sectors which are traditionally short-term and reactive
    in their outlook. The resulting feedback, observations and experiences are
    discussed, together with examples of how the resultant scenarios have been
    applied. An example of causal map reflection (exposing an individual’s
    causal map to others) is also presented, described and critiqued. It was
    found that the process was successful in engaging participants in thinking
    about and discussing the future, appreciating the interconnectivities of the
    related issues, and understanding the collective implications of their
    potential decisions, as well as facilitating the socialisation of
    participant thinking and the construction of collective futures.
