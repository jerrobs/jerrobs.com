  abstract: >-
    Reading a text without spaces in an alphabetic language causes disruption at
    the levels of word identiﬁcation and eye movement control. In the present
    experiment, we examined how word discriminability affects the pattern of eye
    movements when reading unspaced text in an alphabetic language. More
    speciﬁcally, we designed an experiment in which participants read three
    types of sentences: normally written sentences, regular unspaced sentences,
    and alternatingbold unspaced sentences. Although there was a reading cost in
    the unspaced sentences relative to the normally written sentences, this cost
    was much smaller in alternatingbold unspaced sentences than in regular
    unspaced sentences.
