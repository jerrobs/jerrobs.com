  The dark nebula LDN 483 as recorded by the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The object is a region of space clogged with gas and dust. These materials are dense enough to effectively eclipse the light of background stars. LDN 483 is located about 700 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). (Source: ESO)

  Healing **typography** from **space @@ sickness**
description: >
  The _Space Issue_ of the _Journal of Erratic Observations_ takes a closer look at typographic spaces: their function and creation, their multitude of species and annoyance in use.  It concludes with a proposal on how to master them with ease.

In late 1966, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry had James T. Kirk explore space for the first time. The captain of the starship _Enterprise_ was notorious for getting into trouble and getting out again in the end. If Kirk taught us anything, it's that space may be a tough place, but it's a place you can handle.

Over 50 years later, and in the typographic universe, _space_ is a much more worrying place. While the use of appropriate spaces is essential to any decent typography, their application and proofreading suffer from some severe issues. Let's understand space sickness in typography and get rid of it for good.

## Key Observations

- The Unicode Standard lists 15 different space separators, but  many of them just due to compatibilty reasons. Unicode is not clear on what spaces should be used.
-
- The transparent nature of spaces make them difficult to proof-read.
