## Abstract

If you have ever had to visualise particle acceleration in an instructive, numerically accurate and visually appealing way that is also accessible as a still image on paper, a moving picture on screen or an interactive experience on smartphones and desktop computers, your options have been limited. With Pathicles, there might be a solution for you.

A **pathicle** is the visualization of the motion of a particle by sampling this trajectory in equidistant time steps. **Pathicles** is an open source project for creating those pathicles in a web browser by unleashing the parallel computational power of the available graphics processing unit in your device to solve the relativistic equations of motion numerically.

## 1. Results




_Pathicles_ sports the following features: 

**Works in all modern web browsers, even on your smartphone.** _Pathicles_ brings accelerator science to your web browser. No need for special hardware; no need to install special software for scientific computing like a FORTRAN compiler either. _Pathicles_ is designed to run on any modern desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone. However, some features may only work on better environments. Especially, the limited floiating-point precision on mobile devices GPUs can become a bottleneck.

**Small file size.** With _Pathicles_, you can create and explorer stunning interactive animations of particle systems without downloading dozens of megabytes of video files. _Pathicles_ was designed with low download times in mind: Its zipped size is less than 80 kilobytes.

**Responsive real-time rendering.** _Pathicles_ aims to make users explore the science of acceleration by allowing them to play with parameters and see the result immediately. Unlike Hollywood, where rendering a single frame can take hours, _Pathicles'_ rendering must be done in real time, that is, @@ in less than \~10 @@ milliseconds per frame. To achieve responsive real-time rendering, Pathicles uses techniques such as _deferred rendering_, _screen space ambient occlusion_ for shadows, and _multiple X_ for antialiasing.

## 2. Conclusion

- more test cases
- geometric ambient occlusion
- better shadows 
- using OGL instead of regl?
- WebGL @ 2 / WebGPU  
- Pathicles - the game

## Key Observations

- On many mobile devices, you cannot write floating point numbers to textures. Therefore, expensive conversions from floating point numbers to integer representations and back are necessary.
- While there are many examples in the wild of how to use GPU parallism to solve the equation of motion of multi-particle systems, none could be found that is history aware and keeps track of previous values.
- 
- Due to the lack of good debugging tools, debugging WebGL programmes is no fun at all
