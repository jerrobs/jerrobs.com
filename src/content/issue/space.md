  The dark nebula LDN 483 as recorded by the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The object is a region of space clogged with gas and dust. These materials are dense enough to effectively eclipse the light of background stars. LDN 483 is located about 700 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). (Source: ESO)

  Healing **typography** from **space @@ sickness**

  The _Space Issue_ of the _Journal of Erratic Observations_ takes a closer look at typographic spaces between words: What are they good for and since when? Why are there so many of them and what makes them so annoying to deal with? And how do you master them like a pro?

Typography is design and not art. This statement

Her lecture's metap√ºher of optimal ty<pography as a window of glass, beautifully build yet transparent, is still relevant todaywar

<bib-ref cite-key="warde__1930__crystal" />

Sound communication design relies strongly on the proper use of white space.

In late 1966, Star Trek inventor Gene Roddenberry had James T. Kirk explore space -- mankind's "final frontier" -- for the first time. The captain of the starship _Enterprise_ was notorious for getting into trouble and somehow back out again. If Kirk has taught us anything, it's that space may be a cruel place, but can be handled.

50 years later, _space_ in the typographers' universe is a much more worrisome place. While the usage of suitable space characters is essential for any decent typography, this usage is rather tricky. That's because (1) space characters are transparent and (2) Adobe products are not Unicode compliant which has produced a mess which can easily match the debris of the Earth-Romulan War.

> Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. (Opening sequence of Star Trek)

> The _Space Issue_ of the _Journal of Erratic Observation_ looks closely into typographic spaces, why there are quite a mess today, and how to become a true Space Commander.

## Key Observation

- The Unicode Standard lists 15 different space separators, but
  - many of them just due to compatibilty reasons. Unicode is not clear on what spaces should be used.
-
- Space are different to spot.
- The result: Confused type designers and type users.
