His system used only a set of three points of varying heights (distinctiones): media distinctio placed mid-level, serving the function of a comma (a short pause); subdistinctio level with the text, serving the function of a colon or semicolon (a longer pause); and distinctio placed near the top of a line of text, to mark a very long pause (though not necessarily the end of a sentence).</p><p class=md>Aristophanes’ system was never widely used, however, and by the first century B.C., the only punctuation really in use were occasional interpuncts, which the Romans used to indicate word divisions in formal inscriptions, such as those found on buildings and monuments. The interpunct was a small middle dot vertically centered between words, e.g. DONA·NOBIS·REQVIEM. Interpuncts were perhaps the first consistent visual representation of word boundaries in a written language.</p><p class=md>Ancient Greek, by contrast, had not developed interpuncts; all the letters ran together. So, when a wave of enthusiasm for Greek scholarship, language and culture swept ancient Rome, the use of interpuncts died out. Some time after that nearly all writing returned to scriptio continua, that is, no spaces, breaks, or other distinguishing marks between words.</p><p class=md>The use of spaces ( ) for interword separation didn’t appear until much later, roughly 600-800 AD. By the seventh century, the convention was quite common. In some early medieval manuscripts, two vertically aligned dots represented a full stop at the end of a sentence. Eventually one of the dots was dropped, and the remaining dot served as a period, colon or comma, depending on whether it was aligned with the top, middle, or base of the lowercase letters.</p><p class=md>The father of punctuation was probably Aristophanes of Byzantium—the librarian, not the playwright—in the third century B.C. His objective was to give the reader some clues as to how the text should be spoken—not to comply with rules of grammar (a purpose superimposed upon punctuation thousands of years later). He used a system of dots: the longest section (periodos) ended with a high dot, a medium section (colon) ended with a low dot (.), and a short section (comma) ended with a midlevel dot (·).</p><p class=md>Dionysius Thrax (190-170 BCE) was a Hellenistic grammarian a.
